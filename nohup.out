 Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ ( listen); born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket [5]. Cricket world calls him Little Master or Master Blaster[6][7][8][9] and often referred to as the God of Cricket by Indian cricket followers[10][11]. Despite his reputation, he is known for his modesty and humility, once stating "I am not the God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn’t".[12]
 In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[13] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[14] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[15][16][17]
 Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997, India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth and second highest civilian awards.[18] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[19][20] He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the award.[21][22] He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.[23] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[24] He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force.[25] In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia.[26][27]
 In 2010, Time magazine included Sachin in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most Influential People in the World".[28]
In December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs.[29] He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013[30] and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match, against the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.[31] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[5]
 Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[citation needed] to a Maharashtrian[32][33] Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin family.[34] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[35] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[citation needed][36]
 Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[37] He also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe.[38] To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced the young Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[citation needed]
 Ramakant Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[1] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[39] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[40] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[41] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[39]
 Meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield.[42] Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga League,[39] and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India.[43] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[44] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India.[45] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best junior cricket award" (He was 14 years that time). "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me," Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[46][47] Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[48][49] In his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[50] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India.[51]
 On 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[39] He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[39] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[52] He was handpicked to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium nets,[1] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[53]
 Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Raji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth highest run-scorer overall.[54] He also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.[55] Sachin was picked for a young Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in 1988 and 1989.[56] In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay by two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 deliveries was a key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[57]
 His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[1][58] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[59] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.[60][61][62]
 In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from other English counties.[1][Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.[63]
 Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[64] after one first class season.[65] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[66] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it.[67] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[68] This was later called "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.[69] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.[70][71] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[72][73]
 The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[74] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[75] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match.[67] Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also wrote:[76]
 He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen. Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."[77]
 Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. He opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[78][79] It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.
 Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.[80] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[81]
 After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.[citation needed] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.[82] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.[83]
 This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a Test series.[citation needed] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[citation needed] In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[84] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[85][86] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs.[87] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah – the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[88] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[89]
 Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[90]
 The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[91] In the first match, between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Around 100,000 people came to support India during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record.[92] The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people.[93] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[94] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.[95]
 In the Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory. However, he was out when India needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12 runs.[96] The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.[97] However, he returned to the World Cup scoring a century (140 not out off 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.[98]
 Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",[101] which translates into: "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!".[102]
 Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions.[103] Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award[103] as well as player of the match in one of the games.[104] After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000.[105][106]
 During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. The BCCI President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[107]
 In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team.[108] Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light of alleged ball tampering. Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball.[109] This can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball. Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one Test match ban.[110] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism,[111] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.[112] The charges against Tendulkar and Sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.[113]
 Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001. Tendulkar took the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test. He also take a wicket of Shane Warne.This three wicket change the result of test match from draw to win of India.[114] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.[115]
 In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Sir Donald Bradman's record of 29 Test hundreds.He was awarded by Sports car "Ferrari" by Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat.[116][117][118]
 Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four innings.[119] He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost the series.[120] In this period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin scored his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match.[121][122]
 Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[123] helping India reach the final. While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[124][125]
 He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia.[126][127]  As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final.[128]
 The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spend 613 minute at crease. India have a first inning score of 705/7. He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.[129] Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests.[citation needed] It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.[130][better source needed]
 Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests.[131] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise.[132] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.[133][134] After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.[135]
 A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004.[136][137] He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1.[138]
 On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest[needs update] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.[139] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.[140] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[141] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory.[142] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd,[143] the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century.[citation needed] Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.[144]
 During the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian team coach Greg Chappell. Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the latter felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career.[145] Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media.[146] Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms.[145]
 At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a dismal campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against Bangladesh, 57 not out against Bermuda and 0 against Sri Lanka.[citation needed] As a result, former Australian captain Ian Chappell, brother of Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his newspaper column.[147]
 In the subsequent Test series against Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series.[148] He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs.[149] He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.[150][151]
 On the second day of the Nottingham Test on 28 July 2007, Tendulkar became the third cricketer to complete 11,000 Test runs.[152]
In the subsequent one-day series against England, Tendulkar was the leading run scorer from India[153] with an average of 53.42. In the ODI Series against Australia in October 2007 Tendulkar was the leading Indian run scorer with 278 runs.[154]
 Tendulkar was dismissed seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings.[citation needed] Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career.[155] In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali,[156] and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps.[157]
 In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08, Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run scorer with 493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings.[158] Sachin scored 62 runs in the first innings of the first Test at the MCG in Melbourne, but could not prevent a heavy 337-run win for Australia.[159] In the controversial New Years' Test at Sydney, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 154, even though India lost the Test. This was his third century at the SCG and his 38th Test century overall, earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings.[160][161] In the third Test at the WACA cricket ground in Perth, Sachin was instrumental in India's first innings score of 330, scoring a well-compiled 71. India went on to record a historic triumph at the WACA, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive wins.[162] In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126 run stand with V.V.S. Laxman for the fifth wicket to lead India to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4.[163] He secured the Man of the Match award.[164]
 In the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving India, Sri Lanka and Australia, Tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs.[165] He achieved this feat against Sri Lanka on 5 February 2008 at the Gabba in Brisbane. He started the series wth scores of 10, 35, 44 and 32.[166] His form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament,[original research?] but Tendulkar came back strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls.[167] He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final,[168] and 91 runs in the second final.[169]
 South Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series;[171] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.[172]
 Before the Indian cricket team's tour of Sri Lanka in July 2008, Tendulkar needed 177 runs to go past Brian Lara's record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of 95 runs. India lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three matches.[173]
 In the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury.[174] However, during the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first Test[175] before making 88 in the first innings of the second Test, breaking the record for most number of Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000 run mark when he was on 61.[176][177] He described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record.[178] He made a fifty in the third Test[179] and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2–0 and regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.[180]
 Tendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI[181] and 50 in the fifth,[182] before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India.[183][184]
 England returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first Test, which was originally planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to Chennai following the terror attacks.[183][184] Chasing 387 for victory in that match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh.[185] This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and the first which resulted in a win.[186] He dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks.[187] Tendulkar scored poorly in the second Test at Mohali, which ended in a draw. India won the series 1–0.[188]
 In early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai.[citation needed] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches.[189]
 India's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs. In the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. India made 392, won the match[190] and eventually won the series 3–1.[191] Tendulkar made 160 in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won.[192] He made 49 and 64 in the second Test[193] and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two wickets to win. India won the series 1–0.[194][195]
 Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies,[196] but was back for the Compaq Cup Tri Series between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46[197] and 27[198] in the league matches before notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs.[199] This was Tendulkar's sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals.[200]
 Tendulkar played only one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against Pakistan as India lost.[201] The next match against Australia was abandoned due to rain[202] and he was out with a stomach infection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated.[203]
 Australia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games.[204] In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs.[205] Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs.[206][207] During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs,[207][208] and achieved his personal best against Australia,[209] as well as the third highest score in a defeat.[210]
 In the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches,[211] with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous.[212] India won the series 3–1.[213] In the Test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out in the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third Tests respectively as India clinched innings victories in both the Tests, to win the series 2–0.[214]
 Sachin rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent Test series.[215] He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the Tests.[216][217]
 In the two-Test Series against South Africa, Tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first Test.[218] He then scored 106 in the first innings of the second Test, which was his 47th hundred in Test cricket. It was also his fourth hundred in successive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat.[219][220] In the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world's first batsman to score a double century in ODI cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Zimbabwe's Charles Coventry.[Note 2]
 From February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup. Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament.[226] India defeated Sri Lanka in the final.[227] Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that "Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ... I couldn't control my tears of joy."[228]
 India were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate. He returned to the squad in July for India's tour of England.[233] Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined). However his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side.[234][235] The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed.[234] Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi.[236][237]
 Ian Chappell was not happy with Sachin's performance after India's tour of Australia. He says that Sachin's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia.[238] Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Sachin should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup.[citation needed] Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Sachin has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long.[239]
The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Sachin in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.[240]
 Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup.[241] He became the first person in history to achieve this feat, which was also his first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said "It's been a tough phase for me ... I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99 hundreds."[242] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.[243]
 After being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home,[citation needed] in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.[244]
 However, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012,[245] some people have started to question his place in the Indian team. A report by The Hindustan Times said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs.[246] This speculation, however, was later considered to be false.[247][248]
 Then he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy. He scored 108 in the quarter final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora, where Sachin was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium.[249] Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead.[250] In the semi final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Sachin scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70),[251] and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays.[252] In the final against Saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer.[253] Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13.[254]
 He also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India's 526. This was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling Sunil Gavaskar's Indian record for most first-class hundreds.[255]
 Following poor performance in the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his retirement from One Day Internationals on 23 December 2012, while noting that he will be available for Test cricket.[256][257] In response to the news, former India captain Sourav Ganguly noted that Tendulkar could have played the up-coming series against Pakistan, while Anil Kumble said it would be "tough to see an Indian (ODI) team list without Tendulkar's name in it", and Javagal Srinath mentioned that Tendulkar "changed the way ODIs were played right from the time he opened in New Zealand in 1994".[258]
 After playing a Twenty20 International in 2006 against South Africa, he said that he would not play the format again.[259] He announced his retirement from the IPL after his team, Mumbai Indians, beat Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 26 May to win the Indian Premier League 2013.[30] He retired from Twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket, after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in September–October 2013 in India for Mumbai Indians.[260]
 On 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test series against West Indies in November.[261][262] On his request, the BCCI arranged that the two matches were played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell happened at his home ground.[263][264] He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain Virat Kohli.[31][265] The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport.[266][267] Various national and international figures from cricket, politics, Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long Salaam Sachin Conclave organised by India Today.[268][269]
 In July 2014, he captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.[270]
In December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event.[271][272] It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket world cup 2011.[273][274] So he is heading the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).
 Tendulkar was made the icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008.[275] As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya.[276]
 In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony.[277] Sachin has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.[278]
 Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league. He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.[279]
 In the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored 100 not out off 66 balls. In 51 matches in the IPL Tendulkar has scored 1,723 runs, making him the second-highest run-scorer in the competition's history.[280]
In 2013, Sachin retired from Indian Premier League and currently in 2014 he is appointed as the Mumbai Indian Team's 'Icon'.[281][282][283]
 Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand.[284][285] He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the "most wholesome batsman of his time".[1] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia.[1] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.[286] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that "it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does".[287]Equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batman.[288]
 Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that "Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar."[289][290]
 Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.[291] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.[291] He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that "Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke".[292]
 Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.[293]
 While Tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. He often bowls when two batsmen of the opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can often be a useful partnership breaker.[294] With his bowling, he has helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion.[295] He has taken 201 international wickets – 46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's twelfth highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals.[296]
 Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries.[77] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is "Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God".[297] Cricinfo mentions in his profile that "... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."[1] During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said "I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests."[298] However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said "I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn't."[299] Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself.[300]
 There have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, a person hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century.[301]
 At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to "wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night".[292] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence.[302] Tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt, since May 2010.[303]
 Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs.[1] He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals).[5] He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A and Twenty20). He achieved this feat on 5 October 2013, during a Champions League Twenty20 match for his IPL team Mumbai Indians against Trinidad and Tobago.[304][305][306]
 He also holds the record of the highest number of centuries in both Tests (51) and ODIs (49) as well as in Tests and ODIs combined (100). On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred. It came against Bangladesh in the league matches of Asia Cup 2012.[307] He is also the only player to score fifty centuries in Test cricket,[308] and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined.[citation needed] He also holds the world record for playing the highest number of Test matches (200)[309] and ODI matches (463).[310] Tendulkar has been part of most wins by an Indian in both Test cricket with 72 wins and ODIs with 234 wins and is third in the world in ODI victories after Ricky Ponting (262 wins), Mahela Jayawardene (241 wins).[311][312]
 Tendulkar has scored over 1000 runs in a calendar year in ODIs 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1,894 runs, the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for One-Day Internationals.[310] He is the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket.[223]
 He has been Man of the Match 13 times in Test matches and Man of the Series four times, out of them twice in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.[313] The performances earned him respect from Australian cricket fans and players.[77] Similarly he has been Man of the Match 62 times in One day International matches and Man of the Series 15 times.[310] He became the first batsman to score 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 and 15,000 runs in Test cricket,[citation needed] having also been the third batsman and the first Indian to pass 11,000 runs in that form of the game.[314] He was also the first player to score 10,000 runs in one-day internationals,[315] and also the first player to cross every subsequent 1000-run mark that has been crossed in ODI cricket history.[citation needed] In the fourth Test of the 2008–09 Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia at Nagpur on 6 November 2008, Tendulkar surpassed Australia's Allan Border to become the player to cross the 50-run mark the most number of times in Test cricket history,[316] and also the second ever player to score 11 Test centuries against Australia, tying with Sir Jack Hobbs of England more than 70 years previously.[317] On 8 November 2011, Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in Test Cricket.[318]
 Tendulkar has consistently done well in Cricket World Cups. He was the highest run scorer of the 1996 Cricket World Cup with a total of 523 runs and also of the 2003 Cricket World Cup with 673 runs.[319] After his century against England during group stages of 2011 Cricket World Cup, he became the player to hit most number of centuries in Cricket World Cups with six centuries and the first player to score 2000 runs in World Cup cricket.[320][321]
 On 24 May 1995, Tendulkar married Anjali Mehta (b. 1967), a paediatrician of Gujarati origin, whom he had first met in 1990.[340][341][342][343] They have a daughter Sara and a son Arjun whose skills in cricket as a teenager have been receiving attention.[344][345]
 Tendulkar is a practising Hindu. He is a devotee of the deity Ganesha and was a disciple of the guru Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi, whom he visited on several occasions.[346][347][348] In 1997, Tendulkar captained the Indian National side, playing against a World Eleven team, in the Unity Cup which was held at the Sri Sathya Sai Hill View Stadium in Puttaparthi, in Baba's presence.[349][350] The death of Sai Baba on Tendulkar's 38th birthday caused him to cancel his celebrations.[351][352] The cricketer is also known to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at home and frequently visits temples during night when it is calm and quiet.[353][354]
 Tendulkar's popularity has led him to be a pioneer in India on cricket business dealings when he signed a record sports management deal with WorldTel in 1995, the value of the deal being ₹30 crore (US$4.2 million) over five years.[355][356] His next contract with WorldTel in 2001 was valued at ₹80 crore (US$11 million) over five years.[357] In 2006, he signed a contract with Saatchi and Saatchi's ICONIX valued at ₹180 crore (US$25 million) over three years.[358]
 Tendulkar has opened two restaurants: Tendulkar's[359] (Colaba, Mumbai) and Sachin's[360] (Mulund, Mumbai) and Bangalore. Tendulkar owns these restaurants in partnership with Sanjay Narang of Mars Restaurants.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar co-owns the Kochi ISL team in the Indian Super League Football in association with PVP Ventures owned by Prasad V Potluri. The team has been named as Kerala Blasters after his nickname "Master Blaster".[361][362][363] He also jointly owns the badminton team Bengaluru Blasters which participates in the Premier Badminton League.[citation needed]
 In 2013, Tendulkar was listed at 51st position in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, with his total earnings estimated to be USD 22 million.[364] In October 2013, the net worth of Tendulkar was estimated at USD 160 million by Wealth-X, making him India's wealthiest cricket player.[365][366]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been sponsored by several brands throughout his career including Boost (1990–present),[367] Pepsi (1992–2009),[368] Action Shoes (1995–2000),[369] MRF (1999–2009),[370] Adidas (2000–10), Britannia (2001–07),[371] Fiat Palio (2001–03),[372] TVS (2002–05),[373] ESPN Star Sports (2002–present),[374] Sunfeast (2007–13),[375] Canon (2006–09),[376] Airtel (2004–06),[377] Rorito (2016-),[378] G-Hanz (2005–07),[379] Sanyo BPL (2007–present),[380] Toshiba (2010–present),[381] Colgate-Palmolive,[382] Philips,[382] VISA,[382] Castrol India (2011–12),[383] Ujala Techno Bright,[384] Coca-Cola (2011–13)[385] and Musafir.com (2013–present).[386]
 He has also been a spokesperson for National Egg Coordination Committee (2003–05),[387] AIDS Awareness Campaign (2005)[388] and Luminous India (2010–present).[389]
 In April 2012, Tendulkar accepted the Rajya Sabha nomination proposed by the President of India and became the first active sportsperson and cricketer to have been nominated.[24][390] Former cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar,[391] Ajit Wadekar, Madan Lal[392] expressed their surprise over this move. He took the oath of office on 4 June.[393] He refused to take the bungalow allotted to him in New Delhi calling it "waste of taxpayers' money" as he resides in Mumbai.[394] He met with some controversy over his attendance at Rajya Sabha proceedings.[395] Tendulkar has also been accused of not using the development fund Rajya Sabha members receive.[396]
 Tendulkar sponsors 200 underprivileged children every year through Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based NGO associated with his mother-in-law, Annabel Mehta.[397][398] A request by him on Twitter raised ₹1.02 crore (US$140,000) through Sachin's crusade against cancer for the Crusade against Cancer foundation.[399][400] Sachin Tendulkar spent nine hours on the 12-hour Coca-Cola-NDTV Support My School telethon on 18 September 2011 that helped raise ₹ 7 crore – ₹ 2 crore more than the target – for the creation of basic facilities, particularly toilets for girl students, in 140 government schools across the country.[401]
 Sachin Tendulkar’s autobiography, Playing It My Way, was released on 6 November 2014. It was listed in the 2016 Limca Book of Records for breaking the record for adult hardback pre-publication orders, with 1,50,289 copies confirmed.[402]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been the subject of various books. The following is the listing of books focused on Tendulkar's career:

 Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ ( listen); born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket [5]. Cricket world calls him Little Master or Master Blaster[6][7][8][9] and often referred to as the God of Cricket by Indian cricket followers[10][11]. Despite his reputation, he is known for his modesty and humility, once stating "I am not the God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn’t".[12]
 In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[13] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[14] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[15][16][17]
 Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997, India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth and second highest civilian awards.[18] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[19][20] He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the award.[21][22] He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.[23] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[24] He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force.[25] In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia.[26][27]
 In 2010, Time magazine included Sachin in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most Influential People in the World".[28]
In December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs.[29] He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013[30] and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match, against the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.[31] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[5]
 Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[citation needed] to a Maharashtrian[32][33] Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin family.[34] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[35] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[citation needed][36]
 Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[37] He also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe.[38] To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced the young Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[citation needed]
 Ramakant Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[1] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[39] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[40] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[41] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[39]
 Meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield.[42] Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga League,[39] and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India.[43] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[44] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India.[45] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best junior cricket award" (He was 14 years that time). "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me," Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[46][47] Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[48][49] In his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[50] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India.[51]
 On 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[39] He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[39] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[52] He was handpicked to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium nets,[1] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[53]
 Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Raji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth highest run-scorer overall.[54] He also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.[55] Sachin was picked for a young Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in 1988 and 1989.[56] In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay by two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 deliveries was a key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[57]
 His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[1][58] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[59] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.[60][61][62]
 In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from other English counties.[1][Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.[63]
 Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[64] after one first class season.[65] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[66] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it.[67] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[68] This was later called "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.[69] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.[70][71] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[72][73]
 The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[74] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[75] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match.[67] Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also wrote:[76]
 He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen. Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."[77]
 Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. He opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[78][79] It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.
 Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.[80] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[81]
 After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.[citation needed] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.[82] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.[83]
 This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a Test series.[citation needed] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[citation needed] In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[84] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[85][86] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs.[87] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah – the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[88] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[89]
 Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[90]
 The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[91] In the first match, between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Around 100,000 people came to support India during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record.[92] The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people.[93] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[94] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.[95]
 In the Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory. However, he was out when India needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12 runs.[96] The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.[97] However, he returned to the World Cup scoring a century (140 not out off 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.[98]
 Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",[101] which translates into: "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!".[102]
 Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions.[103] Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award[103] as well as player of the match in one of the games.[104] After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000.[105][106]
 During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. The BCCI President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[107]
 In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team.[108] Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light of alleged ball tampering. Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball.[109] This can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball. Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one Test match ban.[110] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism,[111] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.[112] The charges against Tendulkar and Sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.[113]
 Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001. Tendulkar took the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test. He also take a wicket of Shane Warne.This three wicket change the result of test match from draw to win of India.[114] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.[115]
 In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Sir Donald Bradman's record of 29 Test hundreds.He was awarded by Sports car "Ferrari" by Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat.[116][117][118]
 Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four innings.[119] He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost the series.[120] In this period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin scored his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match.[121][122]
 Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[123] helping India reach the final. While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[124][125]
 He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia.[126][127]  As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final.[128]
 The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spend 613 minute at crease. India have a first inning score of 705/7. He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.[129] Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests.[citation needed] It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.[130][better source needed]
 Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests.[131] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise.[132] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.[133][134] After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.[135]
 A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004.[136][137] He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1.[138]
 On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest[needs update] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.[139] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.[140] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[141] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory.[142] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd,[143] the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century.[citation needed] Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.[144]
 During the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian team coach Greg Chappell. Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the latter felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career.[145] Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media.[146] Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms.[145]
 At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a dismal campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against Bangladesh, 57 not out against Bermuda and 0 against Sri Lanka.[citation needed] As a result, former Australian captain Ian Chappell, brother of Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his newspaper column.[147]
 In the subsequent Test series against Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series.[148] He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs.[149] He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.[150][151]
 On the second day of the Nottingham Test on 28 July 2007, Tendulkar became the third cricketer to complete 11,000 Test runs.[152]
In the subsequent one-day series against England, Tendulkar was the leading run scorer from India[153] with an average of 53.42. In the ODI Series against Australia in October 2007 Tendulkar was the leading Indian run scorer with 278 runs.[154]
 Tendulkar was dismissed seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings.[citation needed] Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career.[155] In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali,[156] and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps.[157]
 In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08, Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run scorer with 493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings.[158] Sachin scored 62 runs in the first innings of the first Test at the MCG in Melbourne, but could not prevent a heavy 337-run win for Australia.[159] In the controversial New Years' Test at Sydney, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 154, even though India lost the Test. This was his third century at the SCG and his 38th Test century overall, earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings.[160][161] In the third Test at the WACA cricket ground in Perth, Sachin was instrumental in India's first innings score of 330, scoring a well-compiled 71. India went on to record a historic triumph at the WACA, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive wins.[162] In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126 run stand with V.V.S. Laxman for the fifth wicket to lead India to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4.[163] He secured the Man of the Match award.[164]
 In the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving India, Sri Lanka and Australia, Tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs.[165] He achieved this feat against Sri Lanka on 5 February 2008 at the Gabba in Brisbane. He started the series wth scores of 10, 35, 44 and 32.[166] His form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament,[original research?] but Tendulkar came back strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls.[167] He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final,[168] and 91 runs in the second final.[169]
 South Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series;[171] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.[172]
 Before the Indian cricket team's tour of Sri Lanka in July 2008, Tendulkar needed 177 runs to go past Brian Lara's record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of 95 runs. India lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three matches.[173]
 In the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury.[174] However, during the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first Test[175] before making 88 in the first innings of the second Test, breaking the record for most number of Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000 run mark when he was on 61.[176][177] He described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record.[178] He made a fifty in the third Test[179] and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2–0 and regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.[180]
 Tendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI[181] and 50 in the fifth,[182] before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India.[183][184]
 England returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first Test, which was originally planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to Chennai following the terror attacks.[183][184] Chasing 387 for victory in that match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh.[185] This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and the first which resulted in a win.[186] He dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks.[187] Tendulkar scored poorly in the second Test at Mohali, which ended in a draw. India won the series 1–0.[188]
 In early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai.[citation needed] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches.[189]
 India's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs. In the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. India made 392, won the match[190] and eventually won the series 3–1.[191] Tendulkar made 160 in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won.[192] He made 49 and 64 in the second Test[193] and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two wickets to win. India won the series 1–0.[194][195]
 Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies,[196] but was back for the Compaq Cup Tri Series between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46[197] and 27[198] in the league matches before notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs.[199] This was Tendulkar's sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals.[200]
 Tendulkar played only one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against Pakistan as India lost.[201] The next match against Australia was abandoned due to rain[202] and he was out with a stomach infection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated.[203]
 Australia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games.[204] In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs.[205] Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs.[206][207] During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs,[207][208] and achieved his personal best against Australia,[209] as well as the third highest score in a defeat.[210]
 In the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches,[211] with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous.[212] India won the series 3–1.[213] In the Test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out in the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third Tests respectively as India clinched innings victories in both the Tests, to win the series 2–0.[214]
 Sachin rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent Test series.[215] He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the Tests.[216][217]
 In the two-Test Series against South Africa, Tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first Test.[218] He then scored 106 in the first innings of the second Test, which was his 47th hundred in Test cricket. It was also his fourth hundred in successive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat.[219][220] In the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world's first batsman to score a double century in ODI cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Zimbabwe's Charles Coventry.[Note 2]
 From February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup. Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament.[226] India defeated Sri Lanka in the final.[227] Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that "Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ... I couldn't control my tears of joy."[228]
 India were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate. He returned to the squad in July for India's tour of England.[233] Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined). However his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side.[234][235] The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed.[234] Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi.[236][237]
 Ian Chappell was not happy with Sachin's performance after India's tour of Australia. He says that Sachin's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia.[238] Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Sachin should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup.[citation needed] Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Sachin has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long.[239]
The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Sachin in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.[240]
 Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup.[241] He became the first person in history to achieve this feat, which was also his first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said "It's been a tough phase for me ... I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99 hundreds."[242] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.[243]
 After being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home,[citation needed] in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.[244]
 However, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012,[245] some people have started to question his place in the Indian team. A report by The Hindustan Times said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs.[246] This speculation, however, was later considered to be false.[247][248]
 Then he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy. He scored 108 in the quarter final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora, where Sachin was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium.[249] Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead.[250] In the semi final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Sachin scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70),[251] and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays.[252] In the final against Saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer.[253] Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13.[254]
 He also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India's 526. This was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling Sunil Gavaskar's Indian record for most first-class hundreds.[255]
 Following poor performance in the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his retirement from One Day Internationals on 23 December 2012, while noting that he will be available for Test cricket.[256][257] In response to the news, former India captain Sourav Ganguly noted that Tendulkar could have played the up-coming series against Pakistan, while Anil Kumble said it would be "tough to see an Indian (ODI) team list without Tendulkar's name in it", and Javagal Srinath mentioned that Tendulkar "changed the way ODIs were played right from the time he opened in New Zealand in 1994".[258]
 After playing a Twenty20 International in 2006 against South Africa, he said that he would not play the format again.[259] He announced his retirement from the IPL after his team, Mumbai Indians, beat Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 26 May to win the Indian Premier League 2013.[30] He retired from Twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket, after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in September–October 2013 in India for Mumbai Indians.[260]
 On 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test series against West Indies in November.[261][262] On his request, the BCCI arranged that the two matches were played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell happened at his home ground.[263][264] He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain Virat Kohli.[31][265] The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport.[266][267] Various national and international figures from cricket, politics, Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long Salaam Sachin Conclave organised by India Today.[268][269]
 In July 2014, he captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.[270]
In December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event.[271][272] It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket world cup 2011.[273][274] So he is heading the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).
 Tendulkar was made the icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008.[275] As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya.[276]
 In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony.[277] Sachin has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.[278]
 Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league. He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.[279]
 In the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored 100 not out off 66 balls. In 51 matches in the IPL Tendulkar has scored 1,723 runs, making him the second-highest run-scorer in the competition's history.[280]
In 2013, Sachin retired from Indian Premier League and currently in 2014 he is appointed as the Mumbai Indian Team's 'Icon'.[281][282][283]
 Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand.[284][285] He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the "most wholesome batsman of his time".[1] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia.[1] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.[286] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that "it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does".[287]Equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batman.[288]
 Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that "Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar."[289][290]
 Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.[291] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.[291] He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that "Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke".[292]
 Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.[293]
 While Tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. He often bowls when two batsmen of the opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can often be a useful partnership breaker.[294] With his bowling, he has helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion.[295] He has taken 201 international wickets – 46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's twelfth highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals.[296]
 Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries.[77] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is "Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God".[297] Cricinfo mentions in his profile that "... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."[1] During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said "I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests."[298] However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said "I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn't."[299] Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself.[300]
 There have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, a person hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century.[301]
 At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to "wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night".[292] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence.[302] Tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt, since May 2010.[303]
 Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs.[1] He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals).[5] He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A and Twenty20). He achieved this feat on 5 October 2013, during a Champions League Twenty20 match for his IPL team Mumbai Indians against Trinidad and Tobago.[304][305][306]
 He also holds the record of the highest number of centuries in both Tests (51) and ODIs (49) as well as in Tests and ODIs combined (100). On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred. It came against Bangladesh in the league matches of Asia Cup 2012.[307] He is also the only player to score fifty centuries in Test cricket,[308] and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined.[citation needed] He also holds the world record for playing the highest number of Test matches (200)[309] and ODI matches (463).[310] Tendulkar has been part of most wins by an Indian in both Test cricket with 72 wins and ODIs with 234 wins and is third in the world in ODI victories after Ricky Ponting (262 wins), Mahela Jayawardene (241 wins).[311][312]
 Tendulkar has scored over 1000 runs in a calendar year in ODIs 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1,894 runs, the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for One-Day Internationals.[310] He is the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket.[223]
 He has been Man of the Match 13 times in Test matches and Man of the Series four times, out of them twice in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.[313] The performances earned him respect from Australian cricket fans and players.[77] Similarly he has been Man of the Match 62 times in One day International matches and Man of the Series 15 times.[310] He became the first batsman to score 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 and 15,000 runs in Test cricket,[citation needed] having also been the third batsman and the first Indian to pass 11,000 runs in that form of the game.[314] He was also the first player to score 10,000 runs in one-day internationals,[315] and also the first player to cross every subsequent 1000-run mark that has been crossed in ODI cricket history.[citation needed] In the fourth Test of the 2008–09 Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia at Nagpur on 6 November 2008, Tendulkar surpassed Australia's Allan Border to become the player to cross the 50-run mark the most number of times in Test cricket history,[316] and also the second ever player to score 11 Test centuries against Australia, tying with Sir Jack Hobbs of England more than 70 years previously.[317] On 8 November 2011, Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in Test Cricket.[318]
 Tendulkar has consistently done well in Cricket World Cups. He was the highest run scorer of the 1996 Cricket World Cup with a total of 523 runs and also of the 2003 Cricket World Cup with 673 runs.[319] After his century against England during group stages of 2011 Cricket World Cup, he became the player to hit most number of centuries in Cricket World Cups with six centuries and the first player to score 2000 runs in World Cup cricket.[320][321]
 On 24 May 1995, Tendulkar married Anjali Mehta (b. 1967), a paediatrician of Gujarati origin, whom he had first met in 1990.[340][341][342][343] They have a daughter Sara and a son Arjun whose skills in cricket as a teenager have been receiving attention.[344][345]
 Tendulkar is a practising Hindu. He is a devotee of the deity Ganesha and was a disciple of the guru Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi, whom he visited on several occasions.[346][347][348] In 1997, Tendulkar captained the Indian National side, playing against a World Eleven team, in the Unity Cup which was held at the Sri Sathya Sai Hill View Stadium in Puttaparthi, in Baba's presence.[349][350] The death of Sai Baba on Tendulkar's 38th birthday caused him to cancel his celebrations.[351][352] The cricketer is also known to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at home and frequently visits temples during night when it is calm and quiet.[353][354]
 Tendulkar's popularity has led him to be a pioneer in India on cricket business dealings when he signed a record sports management deal with WorldTel in 1995, the value of the deal being ₹30 crore (US$4.2 million) over five years.[355][356] His next contract with WorldTel in 2001 was valued at ₹80 crore (US$11 million) over five years.[357] In 2006, he signed a contract with Saatchi and Saatchi's ICONIX valued at ₹180 crore (US$25 million) over three years.[358]
 Tendulkar has opened two restaurants: Tendulkar's[359] (Colaba, Mumbai) and Sachin's[360] (Mulund, Mumbai) and Bangalore. Tendulkar owns these restaurants in partnership with Sanjay Narang of Mars Restaurants.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar co-owns the Kochi ISL team in the Indian Super League Football in association with PVP Ventures owned by Prasad V Potluri. The team has been named as Kerala Blasters after his nickname "Master Blaster".[361][362][363] He also jointly owns the badminton team Bengaluru Blasters which participates in the Premier Badminton League.[citation needed]
 In 2013, Tendulkar was listed at 51st position in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, with his total earnings estimated to be USD 22 million.[364] In October 2013, the net worth of Tendulkar was estimated at USD 160 million by Wealth-X, making him India's wealthiest cricket player.[365][366]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been sponsored by several brands throughout his career including Boost (1990–present),[367] Pepsi (1992–2009),[368] Action Shoes (1995–2000),[369] MRF (1999–2009),[370] Adidas (2000–10), Britannia (2001–07),[371] Fiat Palio (2001–03),[372] TVS (2002–05),[373] ESPN Star Sports (2002–present),[374] Sunfeast (2007–13),[375] Canon (2006–09),[376] Airtel (2004–06),[377] Rorito (2016-),[378] G-Hanz (2005–07),[379] Sanyo BPL (2007–present),[380] Toshiba (2010–present),[381] Colgate-Palmolive,[382] Philips,[382] VISA,[382] Castrol India (2011–12),[383] Ujala Techno Bright,[384] Coca-Cola (2011–13)[385] and Musafir.com (2013–present).[386]
 He has also been a spokesperson for National Egg Coordination Committee (2003–05),[387] AIDS Awareness Campaign (2005)[388] and Luminous India (2010–present).[389]
 In April 2012, Tendulkar accepted the Rajya Sabha nomination proposed by the President of India and became the first active sportsperson and cricketer to have been nominated.[24][390] Former cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar,[391] Ajit Wadekar, Madan Lal[392] expressed their surprise over this move. He took the oath of office on 4 June.[393] He refused to take the bungalow allotted to him in New Delhi calling it "waste of taxpayers' money" as he resides in Mumbai.[394] He met with some controversy over his attendance at Rajya Sabha proceedings.[395] Tendulkar has also been accused of not using the development fund Rajya Sabha members receive.[396]
 Tendulkar sponsors 200 underprivileged children every year through Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based NGO associated with his mother-in-law, Annabel Mehta.[397][398] A request by him on Twitter raised ₹1.02 crore (US$140,000) through Sachin's crusade against cancer for the Crusade against Cancer foundation.[399][400] Sachin Tendulkar spent nine hours on the 12-hour Coca-Cola-NDTV Support My School telethon on 18 September 2011 that helped raise ₹ 7 crore – ₹ 2 crore more than the target – for the creation of basic facilities, particularly toilets for girl students, in 140 government schools across the country.[401]
 Sachin Tendulkar’s autobiography, Playing It My Way, was released on 6 November 2014. It was listed in the 2016 Limca Book of Records for breaking the record for adult hardback pre-publication orders, with 1,50,289 copies confirmed.[402]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been the subject of various books. The following is the listing of books focused on Tendulkar's career:

 Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ ( listen); born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket [5]. Cricket world calls him Little Master or Master Blaster[6][7][8][9] and often referred to as the God of Cricket by Indian cricket followers[10][11]. Despite his reputation, he is known for his modesty and humility, once stating "I am not the God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn’t".[12]
 In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[13] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[14] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[15][16][17]
 Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997, India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth and second highest civilian awards.[18] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[19][20] He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the award.[21][22] He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.[23] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[24] He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force.[25] In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia.[26][27]
 In 2010, Time magazine included Sachin in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most Influential People in the World".[28]
In December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs.[29] He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013[30] and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match, against the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.[31] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[5]
 Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[citation needed] to a Maharashtrian[32][33] Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin family.[34] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[35] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[citation needed][36]
 Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[37] He also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe.[38] To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced the young Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[citation needed]
 Ramakant Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[1] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[39] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[40] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[41] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[39]
 Meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield.[42] Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga League,[39] and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India.[43] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[44] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India.[45] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best junior cricket award" (He was 14 years that time). "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me," Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[46][47] Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[48][49] In his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[50] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India.[51]
 On 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[39] He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[39] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[52] He was handpicked to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium nets,[1] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[53]
 Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Raji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth highest run-scorer overall.[54] He also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.[55] Sachin was picked for a young Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in 1988 and 1989.[56] In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay by two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 deliveries was a key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[57]
 His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[1][58] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[59] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.[60][61][62]
 In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from other English counties.[1][Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.[63]
 Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[64] after one first class season.[65] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[66] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it.[67] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[68] This was later called "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.[69] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.[70][71] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[72][73]
 The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[74] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[75] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match.[67] Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also wrote:[76]
 He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen. Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."[77]
 Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. He opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[78][79] It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.
 Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.[80] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[81]
 After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.[citation needed] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.[82] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.[83]
 This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a Test series.[citation needed] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[citation needed] In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[84] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[85][86] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs.[87] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah – the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[88] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[89]
 Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[90]
 The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[91] In the first match, between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Around 100,000 people came to support India during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record.[92] The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people.[93] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[94] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.[95]
 In the Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory. However, he was out when India needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12 runs.[96] The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.[97] However, he returned to the World Cup scoring a century (140 not out off 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.[98]
 Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",[101] which translates into: "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!".[102]
 Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions.[103] Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award[103] as well as player of the match in one of the games.[104] After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000.[105][106]
 During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. The BCCI President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[107]
 In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team.[108] Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light of alleged ball tampering. Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball.[109] This can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball. Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one Test match ban.[110] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism,[111] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.[112] The charges against Tendulkar and Sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.[113]
 Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001. Tendulkar took the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test. He also take a wicket of Shane Warne.This three wicket change the result of test match from draw to win of India.[114] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.[115]
 In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Sir Donald Bradman's record of 29 Test hundreds.He was awarded by Sports car "Ferrari" by Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat.[116][117][118]
 Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four innings.[119] He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost the series.[120] In this period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin scored his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match.[121][122]
 Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[123] helping India reach the final. While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[124][125]
 He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia.[126][127]  As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final.[128]
 The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spend 613 minute at crease. India have a first inning score of 705/7. He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.[129] Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests.[citation needed] It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.[130][better source needed]
 Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests.[131] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise.[132] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.[133][134] After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.[135]
 A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004.[136][137] He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1.[138]
 On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest[needs update] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.[139] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.[140] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[141] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory.[142] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd,[143] the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century.[citation needed] Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.[144]
 During the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian team coach Greg Chappell. Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the latter felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career.[145] Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media.[146] Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms.[145]
 At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a dismal campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against Bangladesh, 57 not out against Bermuda and 0 against Sri Lanka.[citation needed] As a result, former Australian captain Ian Chappell, brother of Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his newspaper column.[147]
 In the subsequent Test series against Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series.[148] He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs.[149] He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.[150][151]
 On the second day of the Nottingham Test on 28 July 2007, Tendulkar became the third cricketer to complete 11,000 Test runs.[152]
In the subsequent one-day series against England, Tendulkar was the leading run scorer from India[153] with an average of 53.42. In the ODI Series against Australia in October 2007 Tendulkar was the leading Indian run scorer with 278 runs.[154]
 Tendulkar was dismissed seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings.[citation needed] Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career.[155] In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali,[156] and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps.[157]
 In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08, Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run scorer with 493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings.[158] Sachin scored 62 runs in the first innings of the first Test at the MCG in Melbourne, but could not prevent a heavy 337-run win for Australia.[159] In the controversial New Years' Test at Sydney, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 154, even though India lost the Test. This was his third century at the SCG and his 38th Test century overall, earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings.[160][161] In the third Test at the WACA cricket ground in Perth, Sachin was instrumental in India's first innings score of 330, scoring a well-compiled 71. India went on to record a historic triumph at the WACA, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive wins.[162] In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126 run stand with V.V.S. Laxman for the fifth wicket to lead India to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4.[163] He secured the Man of the Match award.[164]
 In the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving India, Sri Lanka and Australia, Tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs.[165] He achieved this feat against Sri Lanka on 5 February 2008 at the Gabba in Brisbane. He started the series wth scores of 10, 35, 44 and 32.[166] His form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament,[original research?] but Tendulkar came back strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls.[167] He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final,[168] and 91 runs in the second final.[169]
 South Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series;[171] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.[172]
 Before the Indian cricket team's tour of Sri Lanka in July 2008, Tendulkar needed 177 runs to go past Brian Lara's record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of 95 runs. India lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three matches.[173]
 In the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury.[174] However, during the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first Test[175] before making 88 in the first innings of the second Test, breaking the record for most number of Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000 run mark when he was on 61.[176][177] He described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record.[178] He made a fifty in the third Test[179] and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2–0 and regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.[180]
 Tendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI[181] and 50 in the fifth,[182] before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India.[183][184]
 England returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first Test, which was originally planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to Chennai following the terror attacks.[183][184] Chasing 387 for victory in that match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh.[185] This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and the first which resulted in a win.[186] He dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks.[187] Tendulkar scored poorly in the second Test at Mohali, which ended in a draw. India won the series 1–0.[188]
 In early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai.[citation needed] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches.[189]
 India's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs. In the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. India made 392, won the match[190] and eventually won the series 3–1.[191] Tendulkar made 160 in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won.[192] He made 49 and 64 in the second Test[193] and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two wickets to win. India won the series 1–0.[194][195]
 Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies,[196] but was back for the Compaq Cup Tri Series between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46[197] and 27[198] in the league matches before notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs.[199] This was Tendulkar's sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals.[200]
 Tendulkar played only one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against Pakistan as India lost.[201] The next match against Australia was abandoned due to rain[202] and he was out with a stomach infection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated.[203]
 Australia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games.[204] In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs.[205] Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs.[206][207] During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs,[207][208] and achieved his personal best against Australia,[209] as well as the third highest score in a defeat.[210]
 In the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches,[211] with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous.[212] India won the series 3–1.[213] In the Test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out in the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third Tests respectively as India clinched innings victories in both the Tests, to win the series 2–0.[214]
 Sachin rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent Test series.[215] He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the Tests.[216][217]
 In the two-Test Series against South Africa, Tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first Test.[218] He then scored 106 in the first innings of the second Test, which was his 47th hundred in Test cricket. It was also his fourth hundred in successive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat.[219][220] In the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world's first batsman to score a double century in ODI cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Zimbabwe's Charles Coventry.[Note 2]
 From February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup. Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament.[226] India defeated Sri Lanka in the final.[227] Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that "Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ... I couldn't control my tears of joy."[228]
 India were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate. He returned to the squad in July for India's tour of England.[233] Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined). However his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side.[234][235] The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed.[234] Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi.[236][237]
 Ian Chappell was not happy with Sachin's performance after India's tour of Australia. He says that Sachin's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia.[238] Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Sachin should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup.[citation needed] Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Sachin has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long.[239]
The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Sachin in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.[240]
 Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup.[241] He became the first person in history to achieve this feat, which was also his first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said "It's been a tough phase for me ... I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99 hundreds."[242] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.[243]
 After being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home,[citation needed] in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.[244]
 However, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012,[245] some people have started to question his place in the Indian team. A report by The Hindustan Times said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs.[246] This speculation, however, was later considered to be false.[247][248]
 Then he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy. He scored 108 in the quarter final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora, where Sachin was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium.[249] Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead.[250] In the semi final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Sachin scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70),[251] and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays.[252] In the final against Saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer.[253] Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13.[254]
 He also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India's 526. This was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling Sunil Gavaskar's Indian record for most first-class hundreds.[255]
 Following poor performance in the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his retirement from One Day Internationals on 23 December 2012, while noting that he will be available for Test cricket.[256][257] In response to the news, former India captain Sourav Ganguly noted that Tendulkar could have played the up-coming series against Pakistan, while Anil Kumble said it would be "tough to see an Indian (ODI) team list without Tendulkar's name in it", and Javagal Srinath mentioned that Tendulkar "changed the way ODIs were played right from the time he opened in New Zealand in 1994".[258]
 After playing a Twenty20 International in 2006 against South Africa, he said that he would not play the format again.[259] He announced his retirement from the IPL after his team, Mumbai Indians, beat Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 26 May to win the Indian Premier League 2013.[30] He retired from Twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket, after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in September–October 2013 in India for Mumbai Indians.[260]
 On 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test series against West Indies in November.[261][262] On his request, the BCCI arranged that the two matches were played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell happened at his home ground.[263][264] He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain Virat Kohli.[31][265] The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport.[266][267] Various national and international figures from cricket, politics, Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long Salaam Sachin Conclave organised by India Today.[268][269]
 In July 2014, he captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.[270]
In December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event.[271][272] It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket world cup 2011.[273][274] So he is heading the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).
 Tendulkar was made the icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008.[275] As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya.[276]
 In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony.[277] Sachin has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.[278]
 Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league. He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.[279]
 In the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored 100 not out off 66 balls. In 51 matches in the IPL Tendulkar has scored 1,723 runs, making him the second-highest run-scorer in the competition's history.[280]
In 2013, Sachin retired from Indian Premier League and currently in 2014 he is appointed as the Mumbai Indian Team's 'Icon'.[281][282][283]
 Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand.[284][285] He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the "most wholesome batsman of his time".[1] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia.[1] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.[286] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that "it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does".[287]Equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batman.[288]
 Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that "Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar."[289][290]
 Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.[291] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.[291] He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that "Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke".[292]
 Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.[293]
 While Tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. He often bowls when two batsmen of the opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can often be a useful partnership breaker.[294] With his bowling, he has helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion.[295] He has taken 201 international wickets – 46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's twelfth highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals.[296]
 Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries.[77] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is "Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God".[297] Cricinfo mentions in his profile that "... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."[1] During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said "I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests."[298] However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said "I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn't."[299] Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself.[300]
 There have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, a person hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century.[301]
 At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to "wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night".[292] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence.[302] Tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt, since May 2010.[303]
 Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs.[1] He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals).[5] He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A and Twenty20). He achieved this feat on 5 October 2013, during a Champions League Twenty20 match for his IPL team Mumbai Indians against Trinidad and Tobago.[304][305][306]
 He also holds the record of the highest number of centuries in both Tests (51) and ODIs (49) as well as in Tests and ODIs combined (100). On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred. It came against Bangladesh in the league matches of Asia Cup 2012.[307] He is also the only player to score fifty centuries in Test cricket,[308] and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined.[citation needed] He also holds the world record for playing the highest number of Test matches (200)[309] and ODI matches (463).[310] Tendulkar has been part of most wins by an Indian in both Test cricket with 72 wins and ODIs with 234 wins and is third in the world in ODI victories after Ricky Ponting (262 wins), Mahela Jayawardene (241 wins).[311][312]
 Tendulkar has scored over 1000 runs in a calendar year in ODIs 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1,894 runs, the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for One-Day Internationals.[310] He is the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket.[223]
 He has been Man of the Match 13 times in Test matches and Man of the Series four times, out of them twice in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.[313] The performances earned him respect from Australian cricket fans and players.[77] Similarly he has been Man of the Match 62 times in One day International matches and Man of the Series 15 times.[310] He became the first batsman to score 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 and 15,000 runs in Test cricket,[citation needed] having also been the third batsman and the first Indian to pass 11,000 runs in that form of the game.[314] He was also the first player to score 10,000 runs in one-day internationals,[315] and also the first player to cross every subsequent 1000-run mark that has been crossed in ODI cricket history.[citation needed] In the fourth Test of the 2008–09 Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia at Nagpur on 6 November 2008, Tendulkar surpassed Australia's Allan Border to become the player to cross the 50-run mark the most number of times in Test cricket history,[316] and also the second ever player to score 11 Test centuries against Australia, tying with Sir Jack Hobbs of England more than 70 years previously.[317] On 8 November 2011, Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in Test Cricket.[318]
 Tendulkar has consistently done well in Cricket World Cups. He was the highest run scorer of the 1996 Cricket World Cup with a total of 523 runs and also of the 2003 Cricket World Cup with 673 runs.[319] After his century against England during group stages of 2011 Cricket World Cup, he became the player to hit most number of centuries in Cricket World Cups with six centuries and the first player to score 2000 runs in World Cup cricket.[320][321]
 On 24 May 1995, Tendulkar married Anjali Mehta (b. 1967), a paediatrician of Gujarati origin, whom he had first met in 1990.[340][341][342][343] They have a daughter Sara and a son Arjun whose skills in cricket as a teenager have been receiving attention.[344][345]
 Tendulkar is a practising Hindu. He is a devotee of the deity Ganesha and was a disciple of the guru Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi, whom he visited on several occasions.[346][347][348] In 1997, Tendulkar captained the Indian National side, playing against a World Eleven team, in the Unity Cup which was held at the Sri Sathya Sai Hill View Stadium in Puttaparthi, in Baba's presence.[349][350] The death of Sai Baba on Tendulkar's 38th birthday caused him to cancel his celebrations.[351][352] The cricketer is also known to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at home and frequently visits temples during night when it is calm and quiet.[353][354]
 Tendulkar's popularity has led him to be a pioneer in India on cricket business dealings when he signed a record sports management deal with WorldTel in 1995, the value of the deal being ₹30 crore (US$4.2 million) over five years.[355][356] His next contract with WorldTel in 2001 was valued at ₹80 crore (US$11 million) over five years.[357] In 2006, he signed a contract with Saatchi and Saatchi's ICONIX valued at ₹180 crore (US$25 million) over three years.[358]
 Tendulkar has opened two restaurants: Tendulkar's[359] (Colaba, Mumbai) and Sachin's[360] (Mulund, Mumbai) and Bangalore. Tendulkar owns these restaurants in partnership with Sanjay Narang of Mars Restaurants.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar co-owns the Kochi ISL team in the Indian Super League Football in association with PVP Ventures owned by Prasad V Potluri. The team has been named as Kerala Blasters after his nickname "Master Blaster".[361][362][363] He also jointly owns the badminton team Bengaluru Blasters which participates in the Premier Badminton League.[citation needed]
 In 2013, Tendulkar was listed at 51st position in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, with his total earnings estimated to be USD 22 million.[364] In October 2013, the net worth of Tendulkar was estimated at USD 160 million by Wealth-X, making him India's wealthiest cricket player.[365][366]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been sponsored by several brands throughout his career including Boost (1990–present),[367] Pepsi (1992–2009),[368] Action Shoes (1995–2000),[369] MRF (1999–2009),[370] Adidas (2000–10), Britannia (2001–07),[371] Fiat Palio (2001–03),[372] TVS (2002–05),[373] ESPN Star Sports (2002–present),[374] Sunfeast (2007–13),[375] Canon (2006–09),[376] Airtel (2004–06),[377] Rorito (2016-),[378] G-Hanz (2005–07),[379] Sanyo BPL (2007–present),[380] Toshiba (2010–present),[381] Colgate-Palmolive,[382] Philips,[382] VISA,[382] Castrol India (2011–12),[383] Ujala Techno Bright,[384] Coca-Cola (2011–13)[385] and Musafir.com (2013–present).[386]
 He has also been a spokesperson for National Egg Coordination Committee (2003–05),[387] AIDS Awareness Campaign (2005)[388] and Luminous India (2010–present).[389]
 In April 2012, Tendulkar accepted the Rajya Sabha nomination proposed by the President of India and became the first active sportsperson and cricketer to have been nominated.[24][390] Former cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar,[391] Ajit Wadekar, Madan Lal[392] expressed their surprise over this move. He took the oath of office on 4 June.[393] He refused to take the bungalow allotted to him in New Delhi calling it "waste of taxpayers' money" as he resides in Mumbai.[394] He met with some controversy over his attendance at Rajya Sabha proceedings.[395] Tendulkar has also been accused of not using the development fund Rajya Sabha members receive.[396]
 Tendulkar sponsors 200 underprivileged children every year through Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based NGO associated with his mother-in-law, Annabel Mehta.[397][398] A request by him on Twitter raised ₹1.02 crore (US$140,000) through Sachin's crusade against cancer for the Crusade against Cancer foundation.[399][400] Sachin Tendulkar spent nine hours on the 12-hour Coca-Cola-NDTV Support My School telethon on 18 September 2011 that helped raise ₹ 7 crore – ₹ 2 crore more than the target – for the creation of basic facilities, particularly toilets for girl students, in 140 government schools across the country.[401]
 Sachin Tendulkar’s autobiography, Playing It My Way, was released on 6 November 2014. It was listed in the 2016 Limca Book of Records for breaking the record for adult hardback pre-publication orders, with 1,50,289 copies confirmed.[402]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been the subject of various books. The following is the listing of books focused on Tendulkar's career:

APACHE FLUMEFlume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data. It has a simple and flexible architecture based on streaming data flows. Flume is a standard, simple, robust, flexible, and extensible tool for data ingestion from various data producers (webservers) into Hadoop..Why Apache Flume?There are several advantages of Apache Flume which makes it a better choice over others. The advantages are:Flume is scalable, reliable, fault tolerant and customizable for different sources and sinks.Apache Flume can store data in centralized stores (i.e data is supplied from a single store) like HBase & HDFS. Flume is horizontally scalable.If the read rate exceeds the write rate, Flume provides a steady flow of data between read and write operations.Flume provides reliable message delivery. The transactions in Flume are channel-based where two transactions (one sender & one receiver) are maintained for each message.Using Flume, we can ingest data from multiple servers into Hadoop.It gives us a solution which is reliable and distributed and helps us in collecting, aggregating and moving large amount of data sets like Facebook, Twitter and e-commerce websites.It helps us to ingest online streaming data from various sources like network traffic, social media, email messages, log files etc. in HDFS.It supports a large set of sources and destinations types.Multi-hop flows, fan-in fan-out flows, contextual routing, etc are supported by Flume.Flume can be scaled horizontally.Apache Flume Architecture      The data generators (like Facebook, Twitter) generates data which gets collected by individual Flume agents running on them. Afterward, another agent is data collector which collects all the data from the agents which are aggregated. Then pushed it into a centralized store like HDFS or HBase.Flume EventAn agent is an independent daemon process (JVM) in Flume. It receives the data (events) from clients or other agents and forwards it to its next destination (sink or agent). Flume may have more than one agent. Following diagram represents a Flume AgentFlume AgentThe flume agent has 3 components: source, sink and channel.Source: It accepts the data from the incoming streamline and stores the data in the channel. Example Avro source, Thrift source, twitter 1% source etc.Channel: In general, the reading speed is faster than the writing speed. Thus, need some buffer to match the read & write speed difference. Basically, the buffer acts as a intermediary storage that stores the data being transferred temporarily and therefore prevents data loss. Similarly, channel acts as the local storage or  a temporary storage between the source of data and persistent data in the HDFS.Example − JDBC channel, File system channel, Memory channel, etc.Sink: Sink, collects the data from the channel and commits or writes the data in the HDFS permanently.Example − HDFS SinkFlume ClientThose which generates events and then sent it to one or more agents is what we call Flume Clients.Additional Components of Flume AgentThere are some more components which play the vital role in transferring Flume events from the data generator to the centralized stores. Apache Flume InterceptorsTo alter/inspect flume events which are transferred between source and channel, we use Flume Interceptors.Channel SelectorsTo determine which channel we should select to transfer the data in case of multiple channels, we use Channel Selector. Channel selectors are generally of two types −Default channel selectors − Replicating channel selectors which replicate all the events in each channel is what we call Default channel selectors.Multiplexing channel selectors − The Channel selectors which decide the channel to send an event based on the address in the header of that event are Multiplexing channel selectors.Sink ProcessorsThese are used to invoke a particular sink from the selected group of sinks. These are used to create failover paths for your sinks or load balance events across multiple sinks from a channel.Flume Data FlowEvents and log data are generated by the log servers and these servers have Flume agents running on them. These agents receive the data from the data generators.The data in these agents will be collected by an intermediate node known as Collector. Just like agents, there can be multiple collectors in Flume.Finally, the data from all these collectors will be aggregated and pushed to a centralized store such as HBase or HDFSMulti-hop FlowWithin Flume, there can be multiple agents and before reaching the final destination, an event may travel through more than one agent. This is known as multi-hop flow.Fan-out FlowThe dataflow from one source to multiple channels is known as fan-out flow. It is of two types −Replicating − The data flow where the data will be replicated in all the configured channels.Multiplexing − The data flow where the data will be sent to a selected channel which is mentioned in the header of the event.Fan-in FlowThe data flow in which the data will be transferred from many sources to one channel is known as fan-in flow.Applications of Apache FlumeFlume is used in e-commerce Company to analyze the customer behavior of different regions.It is used to feed huge log data generated by application servers into HDFS at a higher speed.Flume is used in online analytic application hence it is a backbone for real-time event processing.Limitations of Apache FlumeWeak Ordering GuaranteeWhile it comes to ordering guarantee, Apache flume is very weak in it.DuplicacyIn many scenarios, Flume does not guarantee that message reaching is unique. However, it is a possibility that duplicate messages might pop in at times.Low ScalabilityThere is a slight possibility that for an enterprise, sizing the hardware of a typical Flume can be tricky, and in most cases, it’s trial and error. Hence, its scalability aspect is often low.Reliability issuesWhen the choice of backing store is not chosen wisely considering all factors, scalability and reliability are under question.Apache Flume InstallationFlume Single SourceStep 1:Download Flume from the below link:wget http://www-eu.apache.org/dist/flume/1.6.0/apache-flume-1.6.0-bin.tar.gzStep 2:Untar the downloaded setup, and  moving the setup to the desired location tar -xzf apache-flume-1.6.0-bin.tar.gz sudo mv apache-flume-1.6.0-bin /usr/local/flumeAdd the path of your Apache Flume directory FLUME_HOME path on it vi ~/.bashrc	export FLUME_HOME=/usr/flume	export PATH=$PATH:$FLUME_HOME/bin	export PATH=$PATH:$FLUME_HOME/conf exec bash sudo mv /usr/local/flume/conf/flume-env.sh.template /usr/local/flume/conf/flume-env.sh flume-ng --helpReferenceshttps://flume.apache.org/https://www.edureka.co/blog/apache-flume-tutorial/https://data-flair.training/blogs/apache-flume-tutorial/		6

 Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ ( listen); born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket [5]. Cricket world calls him Little Master or Master Blaster[6][7][8][9] and often referred to as the God of Cricket by Indian cricket followers[10][11]. Despite his reputation, he is known for his modesty and humility, once stating "I am not the God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn’t".[12]
 In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[13] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[14] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[15][16][17]
 Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997, India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth and second highest civilian awards.[18] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[19][20] He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the award.[21][22] He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.[23] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[24] He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force.[25] In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia.[26][27]
 In 2010, Time magazine included Sachin in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most Influential People in the World".[28]
In December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs.[29] He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013[30] and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match, against the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.[31] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[5]
 Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[citation needed] to a Maharashtrian[32][33] Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin family.[34] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[35] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[citation needed][36]
 Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[37] He also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe.[38] To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced the young Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[citation needed]
 Ramakant Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[1] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[39] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[40] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[41] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[39]
 Meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield.[42] Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga League,[39] and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India.[43] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[44] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India.[45] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best junior cricket award" (He was 14 years that time). "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me," Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[46][47] Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[48][49] In his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[50] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India.[51]
 On 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[39] He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[39] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[52] He was handpicked to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium nets,[1] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[53]
 Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Raji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth highest run-scorer overall.[54] He also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.[55] Sachin was picked for a young Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in 1988 and 1989.[56] In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay by two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 deliveries was a key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[57]
 His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[1][58] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[59] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.[60][61][62]
 In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from other English counties.[1][Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.[63]
 Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[64] after one first class season.[65] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[66] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it.[67] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[68] This was later called "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.[69] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.[70][71] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[72][73]
 The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[74] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[75] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match.[67] Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also wrote:[76]
 He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen. Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."[77]
 Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. He opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[78][79] It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.
 Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.[80] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[81]
 After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.[citation needed] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.[82] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.[83]
 This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a Test series.[citation needed] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[citation needed] In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[84] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[85][86] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs.[87] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah – the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[88] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[89]
 Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[90]
 The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[91] In the first match, between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Around 100,000 people came to support India during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record.[92] The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people.[93] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[94] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.[95]
 In the Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory. However, he was out when India needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12 runs.[96] The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.[97] However, he returned to the World Cup scoring a century (140 not out off 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.[98]
 Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",[101] which translates into: "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!".[102]
 Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions.[103] Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award[103] as well as player of the match in one of the games.[104] After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000.[105][106]
 During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. The BCCI President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[107]
 In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team.[108] Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light of alleged ball tampering. Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball.[109] This can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball. Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one Test match ban.[110] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism,[111] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.[112] The charges against Tendulkar and Sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.[113]
 Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001. Tendulkar took the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test. He also take a wicket of Shane Warne.This three wicket change the result of test match from draw to win of India.[114] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.[115]
 In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Sir Donald Bradman's record of 29 Test hundreds.He was awarded by Sports car "Ferrari" by Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat.[116][117][118]
 Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four innings.[119] He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost the series.[120] In this period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin scored his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match.[121][122]
 Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[123] helping India reach the final. While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[124][125]
 He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia.[126][127]  As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final.[128]
 The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spend 613 minute at crease. India have a first inning score of 705/7. He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.[129] Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests.[citation needed] It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.[130][better source needed]
 Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests.[131] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise.[132] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.[133][134] After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.[135]
 A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004.[136][137] He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1.[138]
 On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest[needs update] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.[139] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.[140] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[141] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory.[142] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd,[143] the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century.[citation needed] Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.[144]
 During the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian team coach Greg Chappell. Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the latter felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career.[145] Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media.[146] Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms.[145]
 At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a dismal campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against Bangladesh, 57 not out against Bermuda and 0 against Sri Lanka.[citation needed] As a result, former Australian captain Ian Chappell, brother of Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his newspaper column.[147]
 In the subsequent Test series against Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series.[148] He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs.[149] He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.[150][151]
 On the second day of the Nottingham Test on 28 July 2007, Tendulkar became the third cricketer to complete 11,000 Test runs.[152]
In the subsequent one-day series against England, Tendulkar was the leading run scorer from India[153] with an average of 53.42. In the ODI Series against Australia in October 2007 Tendulkar was the leading Indian run scorer with 278 runs.[154]
 Tendulkar was dismissed seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings.[citation needed] Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career.[155] In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali,[156] and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps.[157]
 In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08, Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run scorer with 493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings.[158] Sachin scored 62 runs in the first innings of the first Test at the MCG in Melbourne, but could not prevent a heavy 337-run win for Australia.[159] In the controversial New Years' Test at Sydney, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 154, even though India lost the Test. This was his third century at the SCG and his 38th Test century overall, earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings.[160][161] In the third Test at the WACA cricket ground in Perth, Sachin was instrumental in India's first innings score of 330, scoring a well-compiled 71. India went on to record a historic triumph at the WACA, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive wins.[162] In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126 run stand with V.V.S. Laxman for the fifth wicket to lead India to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4.[163] He secured the Man of the Match award.[164]
 In the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving India, Sri Lanka and Australia, Tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs.[165] He achieved this feat against Sri Lanka on 5 February 2008 at the Gabba in Brisbane. He started the series wth scores of 10, 35, 44 and 32.[166] His form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament,[original research?] but Tendulkar came back strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls.[167] He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final,[168] and 91 runs in the second final.[169]
 South Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series;[171] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.[172]
 Before the Indian cricket team's tour of Sri Lanka in July 2008, Tendulkar needed 177 runs to go past Brian Lara's record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of 95 runs. India lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three matches.[173]
 In the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury.[174] However, during the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first Test[175] before making 88 in the first innings of the second Test, breaking the record for most number of Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000 run mark when he was on 61.[176][177] He described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record.[178] He made a fifty in the third Test[179] and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2–0 and regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.[180]
 Tendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI[181] and 50 in the fifth,[182] before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India.[183][184]
 England returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first Test, which was originally planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to Chennai following the terror attacks.[183][184] Chasing 387 for victory in that match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh.[185] This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and the first which resulted in a win.[186] He dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks.[187] Tendulkar scored poorly in the second Test at Mohali, which ended in a draw. India won the series 1–0.[188]
 In early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai.[citation needed] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches.[189]
 India's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs. In the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. India made 392, won the match[190] and eventually won the series 3–1.[191] Tendulkar made 160 in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won.[192] He made 49 and 64 in the second Test[193] and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two wickets to win. India won the series 1–0.[194][195]
 Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies,[196] but was back for the Compaq Cup Tri Series between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46[197] and 27[198] in the league matches before notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs.[199] This was Tendulkar's sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals.[200]
 Tendulkar played only one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against Pakistan as India lost.[201] The next match against Australia was abandoned due to rain[202] and he was out with a stomach infection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated.[203]
 Australia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games.[204] In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs.[205] Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs.[206][207] During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs,[207][208] and achieved his personal best against Australia,[209] as well as the third highest score in a defeat.[210]
 In the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches,[211] with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous.[212] India won the series 3–1.[213] In the Test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out in the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third Tests respectively as India clinched innings victories in both the Tests, to win the series 2–0.[214]
 Sachin rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent Test series.[215] He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the Tests.[216][217]
 In the two-Test Series against South Africa, Tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first Test.[218] He then scored 106 in the first innings of the second Test, which was his 47th hundred in Test cricket. It was also his fourth hundred in successive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat.[219][220] In the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world's first batsman to score a double century in ODI cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Zimbabwe's Charles Coventry.[Note 2]
 From February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup. Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament.[226] India defeated Sri Lanka in the final.[227] Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that "Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ... I couldn't control my tears of joy."[228]
 India were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate. He returned to the squad in July for India's tour of England.[233] Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined). However his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side.[234][235] The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed.[234] Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi.[236][237]
 Ian Chappell was not happy with Sachin's performance after India's tour of Australia. He says that Sachin's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia.[238] Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Sachin should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup.[citation needed] Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Sachin has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long.[239]
The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Sachin in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.[240]
 Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup.[241] He became the first person in history to achieve this feat, which was also his first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said "It's been a tough phase for me ... I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99 hundreds."[242] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.[243]
 After being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home,[citation needed] in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.[244]
 However, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012,[245] some people have started to question his place in the Indian team. A report by The Hindustan Times said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs.[246] This speculation, however, was later considered to be false.[247][248]
 Then he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy. He scored 108 in the quarter final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora, where Sachin was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium.[249] Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead.[250] In the semi final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Sachin scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70),[251] and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays.[252] In the final against Saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer.[253] Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13.[254]
 He also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India's 526. This was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling Sunil Gavaskar's Indian record for most first-class hundreds.[255]
 Following poor performance in the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his retirement from One Day Internationals on 23 December 2012, while noting that he will be available for Test cricket.[256][257] In response to the news, former India captain Sourav Ganguly noted that Tendulkar could have played the up-coming series against Pakistan, while Anil Kumble said it would be "tough to see an Indian (ODI) team list without Tendulkar's name in it", and Javagal Srinath mentioned that Tendulkar "changed the way ODIs were played right from the time he opened in New Zealand in 1994".[258]
 After playing a Twenty20 International in 2006 against South Africa, he said that he would not play the format again.[259] He announced his retirement from the IPL after his team, Mumbai Indians, beat Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 26 May to win the Indian Premier League 2013.[30] He retired from Twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket, after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in September–October 2013 in India for Mumbai Indians.[260]
 On 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test series against West Indies in November.[261][262] On his request, the BCCI arranged that the two matches were played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell happened at his home ground.[263][264] He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain Virat Kohli.[31][265] The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport.[266][267] Various national and international figures from cricket, politics, Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long Salaam Sachin Conclave organised by India Today.[268][269]
 In July 2014, he captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.[270]
In December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event.[271][272] It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket world cup 2011.[273][274] So he is heading the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).
 Tendulkar was made the icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008.[275] As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya.[276]
 In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony.[277] Sachin has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.[278]
 Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league. He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.[279]
 In the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored 100 not out off 66 balls. In 51 matches in the IPL Tendulkar has scored 1,723 runs, making him the second-highest run-scorer in the competition's history.[280]
In 2013, Sachin retired from Indian Premier League and currently in 2014 he is appointed as the Mumbai Indian Team's 'Icon'.[281][282][283]
 Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand.[284][285] He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the "most wholesome batsman of his time".[1] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia.[1] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.[286] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that "it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does".[287]Equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batman.[288]
 Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that "Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar."[289][290]
 Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.[291] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.[291] He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that "Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke".[292]
 Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.[293]
 While Tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. He often bowls when two batsmen of the opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can often be a useful partnership breaker.[294] With his bowling, he has helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion.[295] He has taken 201 international wickets – 46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's twelfth highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals.[296]
 Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries.[77] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is "Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God".[297] Cricinfo mentions in his profile that "... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."[1] During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said "I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests."[298] However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said "I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn't."[299] Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself.[300]
 There have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, a person hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century.[301]
 At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to "wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night".[292] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence.[302] Tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt, since May 2010.[303]
 Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs.[1] He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals).[5] He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A and Twenty20). He achieved this feat on 5 October 2013, during a Champions League Twenty20 match for his IPL team Mumbai Indians against Trinidad and Tobago.[304][305][306]
 He also holds the record of the highest number of centuries in both Tests (51) and ODIs (49) as well as in Tests and ODIs combined (100). On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred. It came against Bangladesh in the league matches of Asia Cup 2012.[307] He is also the only player to score fifty centuries in Test cricket,[308] and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined.[citation needed] He also holds the world record for playing the highest number of Test matches (200)[309] and ODI matches (463).[310] Tendulkar has been part of most wins by an Indian in both Test cricket with 72 wins and ODIs with 234 wins and is third in the world in ODI victories after Ricky Ponting (262 wins), Mahela Jayawardene (241 wins).[311][312]
 Tendulkar has scored over 1000 runs in a calendar year in ODIs 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1,894 runs, the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for One-Day Internationals.[310] He is the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket.[223]
 He has been Man of the Match 13 times in Test matches and Man of the Series four times, out of them twice in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.[313] The performances earned him respect from Australian cricket fans and players.[77] Similarly he has been Man of the Match 62 times in One day International matches and Man of the Series 15 times.[310] He became the first batsman to score 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 and 15,000 runs in Test cricket,[citation needed] having also been the third batsman and the first Indian to pass 11,000 runs in that form of the game.[314] He was also the first player to score 10,000 runs in one-day internationals,[315] and also the first player to cross every subsequent 1000-run mark that has been crossed in ODI cricket history.[citation needed] In the fourth Test of the 2008–09 Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia at Nagpur on 6 November 2008, Tendulkar surpassed Australia's Allan Border to become the player to cross the 50-run mark the most number of times in Test cricket history,[316] and also the second ever player to score 11 Test centuries against Australia, tying with Sir Jack Hobbs of England more than 70 years previously.[317] On 8 November 2011, Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in Test Cricket.[318]
 Tendulkar has consistently done well in Cricket World Cups. He was the highest run scorer of the 1996 Cricket World Cup with a total of 523 runs and also of the 2003 Cricket World Cup with 673 runs.[319] After his century against England during group stages of 2011 Cricket World Cup, he became the player to hit most number of centuries in Cricket World Cups with six centuries and the first player to score 2000 runs in World Cup cricket.[320][321]
 On 24 May 1995, Tendulkar married Anjali Mehta (b. 1967), a paediatrician of Gujarati origin, whom he had first met in 1990.[340][341][342][343] They have a daughter Sara and a son Arjun whose skills in cricket as a teenager have been receiving attention.[344][345]
 Tendulkar is a practising Hindu. He is a devotee of the deity Ganesha and was a disciple of the guru Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi, whom he visited on several occasions.[346][347][348] In 1997, Tendulkar captained the Indian National side, playing against a World Eleven team, in the Unity Cup which was held at the Sri Sathya Sai Hill View Stadium in Puttaparthi, in Baba's presence.[349][350] The death of Sai Baba on Tendulkar's 38th birthday caused him to cancel his celebrations.[351][352] The cricketer is also known to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at home and frequently visits temples during night when it is calm and quiet.[353][354]
 Tendulkar's popularity has led him to be a pioneer in India on cricket business dealings when he signed a record sports management deal with WorldTel in 1995, the value of the deal being ₹30 crore (US$4.2 million) over five years.[355][356] His next contract with WorldTel in 2001 was valued at ₹80 crore (US$11 million) over five years.[357] In 2006, he signed a contract with Saatchi and Saatchi's ICONIX valued at ₹180 crore (US$25 million) over three years.[358]
 Tendulkar has opened two restaurants: Tendulkar's[359] (Colaba, Mumbai) and Sachin's[360] (Mulund, Mumbai) and Bangalore. Tendulkar owns these restaurants in partnership with Sanjay Narang of Mars Restaurants.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar co-owns the Kochi ISL team in the Indian Super League Football in association with PVP Ventures owned by Prasad V Potluri. The team has been named as Kerala Blasters after his nickname "Master Blaster".[361][362][363] He also jointly owns the badminton team Bengaluru Blasters which participates in the Premier Badminton League.[citation needed]
 In 2013, Tendulkar was listed at 51st position in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, with his total earnings estimated to be USD 22 million.[364] In October 2013, the net worth of Tendulkar was estimated at USD 160 million by Wealth-X, making him India's wealthiest cricket player.[365][366]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been sponsored by several brands throughout his career including Boost (1990–present),[367] Pepsi (1992–2009),[368] Action Shoes (1995–2000),[369] MRF (1999–2009),[370] Adidas (2000–10), Britannia (2001–07),[371] Fiat Palio (2001–03),[372] TVS (2002–05),[373] ESPN Star Sports (2002–present),[374] Sunfeast (2007–13),[375] Canon (2006–09),[376] Airtel (2004–06),[377] Rorito (2016-),[378] G-Hanz (2005–07),[379] Sanyo BPL (2007–present),[380] Toshiba (2010–present),[381] Colgate-Palmolive,[382] Philips,[382] VISA,[382] Castrol India (2011–12),[383] Ujala Techno Bright,[384] Coca-Cola (2011–13)[385] and Musafir.com (2013–present).[386]
 He has also been a spokesperson for National Egg Coordination Committee (2003–05),[387] AIDS Awareness Campaign (2005)[388] and Luminous India (2010–present).[389]
 In April 2012, Tendulkar accepted the Rajya Sabha nomination proposed by the President of India and became the first active sportsperson and cricketer to have been nominated.[24][390] Former cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar,[391] Ajit Wadekar, Madan Lal[392] expressed their surprise over this move. He took the oath of office on 4 June.[393] He refused to take the bungalow allotted to him in New Delhi calling it "waste of taxpayers' money" as he resides in Mumbai.[394] He met with some controversy over his attendance at Rajya Sabha proceedings.[395] Tendulkar has also been accused of not using the development fund Rajya Sabha members receive.[396]
 Tendulkar sponsors 200 underprivileged children every year through Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based NGO associated with his mother-in-law, Annabel Mehta.[397][398] A request by him on Twitter raised ₹1.02 crore (US$140,000) through Sachin's crusade against cancer for the Crusade against Cancer foundation.[399][400] Sachin Tendulkar spent nine hours on the 12-hour Coca-Cola-NDTV Support My School telethon on 18 September 2011 that helped raise ₹ 7 crore – ₹ 2 crore more than the target – for the creation of basic facilities, particularly toilets for girl students, in 140 government schools across the country.[401]
 Sachin Tendulkar’s autobiography, Playing It My Way, was released on 6 November 2014. It was listed in the 2016 Limca Book of Records for breaking the record for adult hardback pre-publication orders, with 1,50,289 copies confirmed.[402]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been the subject of various books. The following is the listing of books focused on Tendulkar's career:

 Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ ( listen); born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket [5]. Cricket world calls him Little Master or Master Blaster[6][7][8][9] and often referred to as the God of Cricket by Indian cricket followers[10][11]. Despite his reputation, he is known for his modesty and humility, once stating "I am not the God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn’t".[12]
 In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[13] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[14] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[15][16][17]
 Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997, India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth and second highest civilian awards.[18] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[19][20] He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the award.[21][22] He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.[23] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[24] He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force.[25] In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia.[26][27]
 In 2010, Time magazine included Sachin in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most Influential People in the World".[28]
In December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs.[29] He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013[30] and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match, against the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.[31] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[5]
 Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[citation needed] to a Maharashtrian[32][33] Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin family.[34] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[35] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[citation needed][36]
 Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[37] He also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe.[38] To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced the young Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[citation needed]
 Ramakant Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[1] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[39] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[40] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[41] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[39]
 Meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield.[42] Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga League,[39] and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India.[43] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[44] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India.[45] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best junior cricket award" (He was 14 years that time). "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me," Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[46][47] Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[48][49] In his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[50] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India.[51]
 On 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[39] He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[39] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[52] He was handpicked to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium nets,[1] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[53]
 Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Raji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth highest run-scorer overall.[54] He also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.[55] Sachin was picked for a young Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in 1988 and 1989.[56] In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay by two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 deliveries was a key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[57]
 His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[1][58] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[59] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.[60][61][62]
 In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from other English counties.[1][Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.[63]
 Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[64] after one first class season.[65] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[66] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it.[67] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[68] This was later called "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.[69] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.[70][71] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[72][73]
 The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[74] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[75] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match.[67] Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also wrote:[76]
 He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen. Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."[77]
 Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. He opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[78][79] It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.
 Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.[80] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[81]
 After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.[citation needed] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.[82] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.[83]
 This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a Test series.[citation needed] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[citation needed] In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[84] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[85][86] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs.[87] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah – the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[88] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[89]
 Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[90]
 The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[91] In the first match, between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Around 100,000 people came to support India during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record.[92] The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people.[93] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[94] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.[95]
 In the Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory. However, he was out when India needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12 runs.[96] The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.[97] However, he returned to the World Cup scoring a century (140 not out off 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.[98]
 Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",[101] which translates into: "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!".[102]
 Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions.[103] Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award[103] as well as player of the match in one of the games.[104] After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000.[105][106]
 During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. The BCCI President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[107]
 In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team.[108] Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light of alleged ball tampering. Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball.[109] This can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball. Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one Test match ban.[110] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism,[111] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.[112] The charges against Tendulkar and Sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.[113]
 Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001. Tendulkar took the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test. He also take a wicket of Shane Warne.This three wicket change the result of test match from draw to win of India.[114] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.[115]
 In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Sir Donald Bradman's record of 29 Test hundreds.He was awarded by Sports car "Ferrari" by Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat.[116][117][118]
 Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four innings.[119] He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost the series.[120] In this period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin scored his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match.[121][122]
 Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[123] helping India reach the final. While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[124][125]
 He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia.[126][127]  As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final.[128]
 The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spend 613 minute at crease. India have a first inning score of 705/7. He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.[129] Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests.[citation needed] It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.[130][better source needed]
 Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests.[131] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise.[132] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.[133][134] After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.[135]
 A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004.[136][137] He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1.[138]
 On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest[needs update] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.[139] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.[140] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[141] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory.[142] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd,[143] the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century.[citation needed] Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.[144]
 During the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian team coach Greg Chappell. Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the latter felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career.[145] Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media.[146] Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms.[145]
 At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a dismal campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against Bangladesh, 57 not out against Bermuda and 0 against Sri Lanka.[citation needed] As a result, former Australian captain Ian Chappell, brother of Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his newspaper column.[147]
 In the subsequent Test series against Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series.[148] He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs.[149] He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.[150][151]
 On the second day of the Nottingham Test on 28 July 2007, Tendulkar became the third cricketer to complete 11,000 Test runs.[152]
In the subsequent one-day series against England, Tendulkar was the leading run scorer from India[153] with an average of 53.42. In the ODI Series against Australia in October 2007 Tendulkar was the leading Indian run scorer with 278 runs.[154]
 Tendulkar was dismissed seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings.[citation needed] Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career.[155] In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali,[156] and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps.[157]
 In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08, Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run scorer with 493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings.[158] Sachin scored 62 runs in the first innings of the first Test at the MCG in Melbourne, but could not prevent a heavy 337-run win for Australia.[159] In the controversial New Years' Test at Sydney, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 154, even though India lost the Test. This was his third century at the SCG and his 38th Test century overall, earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings.[160][161] In the third Test at the WACA cricket ground in Perth, Sachin was instrumental in India's first innings score of 330, scoring a well-compiled 71. India went on to record a historic triumph at the WACA, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive wins.[162] In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126 run stand with V.V.S. Laxman for the fifth wicket to lead India to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4.[163] He secured the Man of the Match award.[164]
 In the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving India, Sri Lanka and Australia, Tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs.[165] He achieved this feat against Sri Lanka on 5 February 2008 at the Gabba in Brisbane. He started the series wth scores of 10, 35, 44 and 32.[166] His form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament,[original research?] but Tendulkar came back strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls.[167] He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final,[168] and 91 runs in the second final.[169]
 South Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series;[171] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.[172]
 Before the Indian cricket team's tour of Sri Lanka in July 2008, Tendulkar needed 177 runs to go past Brian Lara's record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of 95 runs. India lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three matches.[173]
 In the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury.[174] However, during the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first Test[175] before making 88 in the first innings of the second Test, breaking the record for most number of Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000 run mark when he was on 61.[176][177] He described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record.[178] He made a fifty in the third Test[179] and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2–0 and regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.[180]
 Tendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI[181] and 50 in the fifth,[182] before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India.[183][184]
 England returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first Test, which was originally planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to Chennai following the terror attacks.[183][184] Chasing 387 for victory in that match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh.[185] This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and the first which resulted in a win.[186] He dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks.[187] Tendulkar scored poorly in the second Test at Mohali, which ended in a draw. India won the series 1–0.[188]
 In early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai.[citation needed] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches.[189]
 India's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs. In the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. India made 392, won the match[190] and eventually won the series 3–1.[191] Tendulkar made 160 in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won.[192] He made 49 and 64 in the second Test[193] and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two wickets to win. India won the series 1–0.[194][195]
 Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies,[196] but was back for the Compaq Cup Tri Series between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46[197] and 27[198] in the league matches before notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs.[199] This was Tendulkar's sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals.[200]
 Tendulkar played only one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against Pakistan as India lost.[201] The next match against Australia was abandoned due to rain[202] and he was out with a stomach infection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated.[203]
 Australia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games.[204] In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs.[205] Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs.[206][207] During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs,[207][208] and achieved his personal best against Australia,[209] as well as the third highest score in a defeat.[210]
 In the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches,[211] with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous.[212] India won the series 3–1.[213] In the Test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out in the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third Tests respectively as India clinched innings victories in both the Tests, to win the series 2–0.[214]
 Sachin rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent Test series.[215] He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the Tests.[216][217]
 In the two-Test Series against South Africa, Tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first Test.[218] He then scored 106 in the first innings of the second Test, which was his 47th hundred in Test cricket. It was also his fourth hundred in successive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat.[219][220] In the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world's first batsman to score a double century in ODI cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Zimbabwe's Charles Coventry.[Note 2]
 From February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup. Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament.[226] India defeated Sri Lanka in the final.[227] Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that "Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ... I couldn't control my tears of joy."[228]
 India were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate. He returned to the squad in July for India's tour of England.[233] Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined). However his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side.[234][235] The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed.[234] Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi.[236][237]
 Ian Chappell was not happy with Sachin's performance after India's tour of Australia. He says that Sachin's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia.[238] Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Sachin should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup.[citation needed] Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Sachin has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long.[239]
The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Sachin in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.[240]
 Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup.[241] He became the first person in history to achieve this feat, which was also his first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said "It's been a tough phase for me ... I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99 hundreds."[242] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.[243]
 After being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home,[citation needed] in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.[244]
 However, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012,[245] some people have started to question his place in the Indian team. A report by The Hindustan Times said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs.[246] This speculation, however, was later considered to be false.[247][248]
 Then he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy. He scored 108 in the quarter final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora, where Sachin was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium.[249] Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead.[250] In the semi final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Sachin scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70),[251] and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays.[252] In the final against Saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer.[253] Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13.[254]
 He also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India's 526. This was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling Sunil Gavaskar's Indian record for most first-class hundreds.[255]
 Following poor performance in the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his retirement from One Day Internationals on 23 December 2012, while noting that he will be available for Test cricket.[256][257] In response to the news, former India captain Sourav Ganguly noted that Tendulkar could have played the up-coming series against Pakistan, while Anil Kumble said it would be "tough to see an Indian (ODI) team list without Tendulkar's name in it", and Javagal Srinath mentioned that Tendulkar "changed the way ODIs were played right from the time he opened in New Zealand in 1994".[258]
 After playing a Twenty20 International in 2006 against South Africa, he said that he would not play the format again.[259] He announced his retirement from the IPL after his team, Mumbai Indians, beat Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 26 May to win the Indian Premier League 2013.[30] He retired from Twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket, after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in September–October 2013 in India for Mumbai Indians.[260]
 On 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test series against West Indies in November.[261][262] On his request, the BCCI arranged that the two matches were played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell happened at his home ground.[263][264] He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain Virat Kohli.[31][265] The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport.[266][267] Various national and international figures from cricket, politics, Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long Salaam Sachin Conclave organised by India Today.[268][269]
 In July 2014, he captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.[270]
In December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event.[271][272] It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket world cup 2011.[273][274] So he is heading the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).
 Tendulkar was made the icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008.[275] As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya.[276]
 In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony.[277] Sachin has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.[278]
 Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league. He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.[279]
 In the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored 100 not out off 66 balls. In 51 matches in the IPL Tendulkar has scored 1,723 runs, making him the second-highest run-scorer in the competition's history.[280]
In 2013, Sachin retired from Indian Premier League and currently in 2014 he is appointed as the Mumbai Indian Team's 'Icon'.[281][282][283]
 Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand.[284][285] He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the "most wholesome batsman of his time".[1] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia.[1] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.[286] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that "it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does".[287]Equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batman.[288]
 Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that "Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar."[289][290]
 Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.[291] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.[291] He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that "Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke".[292]
 Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.[293]
 While Tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. He often bowls when two batsmen of the opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can often be a useful partnership breaker.[294] With his bowling, he has helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion.[295] He has taken 201 international wickets – 46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's twelfth highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals.[296]
 Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries.[77] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is "Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God".[297] Cricinfo mentions in his profile that "... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."[1] During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said "I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests."[298] However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said "I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn't."[299] Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself.[300]
 There have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, a person hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century.[301]
 At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to "wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night".[292] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence.[302] Tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt, since May 2010.[303]
 Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs.[1] He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals).[5] He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A and Twenty20). He achieved this feat on 5 October 2013, during a Champions League Twenty20 match for his IPL team Mumbai Indians against Trinidad and Tobago.[304][305][306]
 He also holds the record of the highest number of centuries in both Tests (51) and ODIs (49) as well as in Tests and ODIs combined (100). On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred. It came against Bangladesh in the league matches of Asia Cup 2012.[307] He is also the only player to score fifty centuries in Test cricket,[308] and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined.[citation needed] He also holds the world record for playing the highest number of Test matches (200)[309] and ODI matches (463).[310] Tendulkar has been part of most wins by an Indian in both Test cricket with 72 wins and ODIs with 234 wins and is third in the world in ODI victories after Ricky Ponting (262 wins), Mahela Jayawardene (241 wins).[311][312]
 Tendulkar has scored over 1000 runs in a calendar year in ODIs 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1,894 runs, the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for One-Day Internationals.[310] He is the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket.[223]
 He has been Man of the Match 13 times in Test matches and Man of the Series four times, out of them twice in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.[313] The performances earned him respect from Australian cricket fans and players.[77] Similarly he has been Man of the Match 62 times in One day International matches and Man of the Series 15 times.[310] He became the first batsman to score 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 and 15,000 runs in Test cricket,[citation needed] having also been the third batsman and the first Indian to pass 11,000 runs in that form of the game.[314] He was also the first player to score 10,000 runs in one-day internationals,[315] and also the first player to cross every subsequent 1000-run mark that has been crossed in ODI cricket history.[citation needed] In the fourth Test of the 2008–09 Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia at Nagpur on 6 November 2008, Tendulkar surpassed Australia's Allan Border to become the player to cross the 50-run mark the most number of times in Test cricket history,[316] and also the second ever player to score 11 Test centuries against Australia, tying with Sir Jack Hobbs of England more than 70 years previously.[317] On 8 November 2011, Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in Test Cricket.[318]
 Tendulkar has consistently done well in Cricket World Cups. He was the highest run scorer of the 1996 Cricket World Cup with a total of 523 runs and also of the 2003 Cricket World Cup with 673 runs.[319] After his century against England during group stages of 2011 Cricket World Cup, he became the player to hit most number of centuries in Cricket World Cups with six centuries and the first player to score 2000 runs in World Cup cricket.[320][321]
 On 24 May 1995, Tendulkar married Anjali Mehta (b. 1967), a paediatrician of Gujarati origin, whom he had first met in 1990.[340][341][342][343] They have a daughter Sara and a son Arjun whose skills in cricket as a teenager have been receiving attention.[344][345]
 Tendulkar is a practising Hindu. He is a devotee of the deity Ganesha and was a disciple of the guru Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi, whom he visited on several occasions.[346][347][348] In 1997, Tendulkar captained the Indian National side, playing against a World Eleven team, in the Unity Cup which was held at the Sri Sathya Sai Hill View Stadium in Puttaparthi, in Baba's presence.[349][350] The death of Sai Baba on Tendulkar's 38th birthday caused him to cancel his celebrations.[351][352] The cricketer is also known to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at home and frequently visits temples during night when it is calm and quiet.[353][354]
 Tendulkar's popularity has led him to be a pioneer in India on cricket business dealings when he signed a record sports management deal with WorldTel in 1995, the value of the deal being ₹30 crore (US$4.2 million) over five years.[355][356] His next contract with WorldTel in 2001 was valued at ₹80 crore (US$11 million) over five years.[357] In 2006, he signed a contract with Saatchi and Saatchi's ICONIX valued at ₹180 crore (US$25 million) over three years.[358]
 Tendulkar has opened two restaurants: Tendulkar's[359] (Colaba, Mumbai) and Sachin's[360] (Mulund, Mumbai) and Bangalore. Tendulkar owns these restaurants in partnership with Sanjay Narang of Mars Restaurants.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar co-owns the Kochi ISL team in the Indian Super League Football in association with PVP Ventures owned by Prasad V Potluri. The team has been named as Kerala Blasters after his nickname "Master Blaster".[361][362][363] He also jointly owns the badminton team Bengaluru Blasters which participates in the Premier Badminton League.[citation needed]
 In 2013, Tendulkar was listed at 51st position in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, with his total earnings estimated to be USD 22 million.[364] In October 2013, the net worth of Tendulkar was estimated at USD 160 million by Wealth-X, making him India's wealthiest cricket player.[365][366]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been sponsored by several brands throughout his career including Boost (1990–present),[367] Pepsi (1992–2009),[368] Action Shoes (1995–2000),[369] MRF (1999–2009),[370] Adidas (2000–10), Britannia (2001–07),[371] Fiat Palio (2001–03),[372] TVS (2002–05),[373] ESPN Star Sports (2002–present),[374] Sunfeast (2007–13),[375] Canon (2006–09),[376] Airtel (2004–06),[377] Rorito (2016-),[378] G-Hanz (2005–07),[379] Sanyo BPL (2007–present),[380] Toshiba (2010–present),[381] Colgate-Palmolive,[382] Philips,[382] VISA,[382] Castrol India (2011–12),[383] Ujala Techno Bright,[384] Coca-Cola (2011–13)[385] and Musafir.com (2013–present).[386]
 He has also been a spokesperson for National Egg Coordination Committee (2003–05),[387] AIDS Awareness Campaign (2005)[388] and Luminous India (2010–present).[389]
 In April 2012, Tendulkar accepted the Rajya Sabha nomination proposed by the President of India and became the first active sportsperson and cricketer to have been nominated.[24][390] Former cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar,[391] Ajit Wadekar, Madan Lal[392] expressed their surprise over this move. He took the oath of office on 4 June.[393] He refused to take the bungalow allotted to him in New Delhi calling it "waste of taxpayers' money" as he resides in Mumbai.[394] He met with some controversy over his attendance at Rajya Sabha proceedings.[395] Tendulkar has also been accused of not using the development fund Rajya Sabha members receive.[396]
 Tendulkar sponsors 200 underprivileged children every year through Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based NGO associated with his mother-in-law, Annabel Mehta.[397][398] A request by him on Twitter raised ₹1.02 crore (US$140,000) through Sachin's crusade against cancer for the Crusade against Cancer foundation.[399][400] Sachin Tendulkar spent nine hours on the 12-hour Coca-Cola-NDTV Support My School telethon on 18 September 2011 that helped raise ₹ 7 crore – ₹ 2 crore more than the target – for the creation of basic facilities, particularly toilets for girl students, in 140 government schools across the country.[401]
 Sachin Tendulkar’s autobiography, Playing It My Way, was released on 6 November 2014. It was listed in the 2016 Limca Book of Records for breaking the record for adult hardback pre-publication orders, with 1,50,289 copies confirmed.[402]

 Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ ( listen); born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket [5]. Cricket world calls him Little Master or Master Blaster[6][7][8][9] and often referred to as the God of Cricket by Indian cricket followers[10][11]. Despite his reputation, he is known for his modesty and humility, once stating "I am not the God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn’t".[12]
 In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[13] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[14] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[15][16][17]
 Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997, India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth and second highest civilian awards.[18] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[19][20] He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the award.[21][22] He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.[23] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[24] He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force.[25] In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia.[26][27]
 In 2010, Time magazine included Sachin in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most Influential People in the World".[28]
In December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs.[29] He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013[30] and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match, against the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.[31] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[5]
 Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[citation needed] to a Maharashtrian[32][33] Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin family.[34] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[35] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[citation needed][36]
 Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[37] He also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe.[38] To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced the young Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[citation needed]
 Ramakant Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[1] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[39] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[40] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[41] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[39]
 Meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield.[42] Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga League,[39] and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India.[43] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[44] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India.[45] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best junior cricket award" (He was 14 years that time). "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me," Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[46][47] Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[48][49] In his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[50] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India.[51]
 On 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[39] He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[39] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[52] He was handpicked to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium nets,[1] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[53]
 Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Raji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth highest run-scorer overall.[54] He also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.[55] Sachin was picked for a young Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in 1988 and 1989.[56] In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay by two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 deliveries was a key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[57]
 His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[1][58] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[59] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.[60][61][62]
 In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from other English counties.[1][Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.[63]
 Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[64] after one first class season.[65] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[66] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it.[67] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[68] This was later called "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.[69] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.[70][71] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[72][73]
 The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[74] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[75] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match.[67] Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also wrote:[76]
 He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen. Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."[77]
 Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. He opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[78][79] It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.
 Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.[80] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[81]
 After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.[citation needed] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.[82] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.[83]
 This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a Test series.[citation needed] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[citation needed] In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[84] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[85][86] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs.[87] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah – the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[88] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[89]
 Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[90]
 The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[91] In the first match, between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Around 100,000 people came to support India during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record.[92] The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people.[93] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[94] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.[95]
 In the Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory. However, he was out when India needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12 runs.[96] The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.[97] However, he returned to the World Cup scoring a century (140 not out off 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.[98]
 Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",[101] which translates into: "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!".[102]
 Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions.[103] Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award[103] as well as player of the match in one of the games.[104] After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000.[105][106]
 During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. The BCCI President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[107]
 In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team.[108] Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light of alleged ball tampering. Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball.[109] This can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball. Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one Test match ban.[110] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism,[111] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.[112] The charges against Tendulkar and Sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.[113]
 Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001. Tendulkar took the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test. He also take a wicket of Shane Warne.This three wicket change the result of test match from draw to win of India.[114] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.[115]
 In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Sir Donald Bradman's record of 29 Test hundreds.He was awarded by Sports car "Ferrari" by Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat.[116][117][118]
 Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four innings.[119] He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost the series.[120] In this period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin scored his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match.[121][122]
 Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[123] helping India reach the final. While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[124][125]
 He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia.[126][127]  As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final.[128]
 The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spend 613 minute at crease. India have a first inning score of 705/7. He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.[129] Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests.[citation needed] It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.[130][better source needed]
 Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests.[131] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise.[132] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.[133][134] After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.[135]
 A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004.[136][137] He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1.[138]
 On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest[needs update] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.[139] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.[140] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[141] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory.[142] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd,[143] the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century.[citation needed] Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.[144]
 During the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian team coach Greg Chappell. Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the latter felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career.[145] Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media.[146] Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms.[145]
 At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a dismal campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against Bangladesh, 57 not out against Bermuda and 0 against Sri Lanka.[citation needed] As a result, former Australian captain Ian Chappell, brother of Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his newspaper column.[147]
 In the subsequent Test series against Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series.[148] He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs.[149] He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.[150][151]
 On the second day of the Nottingham Test on 28 July 2007, Tendulkar became the third cricketer to complete 11,000 Test runs.[152]
In the subsequent one-day series against England, Tendulkar was the leading run scorer from India[153] with an average of 53.42. In the ODI Series against Australia in October 2007 Tendulkar was the leading Indian run scorer with 278 runs.[154]
 Tendulkar was dismissed seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings.[citation needed] Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career.[155] In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali,[156] and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps.[157]
 In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08, Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run scorer with 493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings.[158] Sachin scored 62 runs in the first innings of the first Test at the MCG in Melbourne, but could not prevent a heavy 337-run win for Australia.[159] In the controversial New Years' Test at Sydney, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 154, even though India lost the Test. This was his third century at the SCG and his 38th Test century overall, earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings.[160][161] In the third Test at the WACA cricket ground in Perth, Sachin was instrumental in India's first innings score of 330, scoring a well-compiled 71. India went on to record a historic triumph at the WACA, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive wins.[162] In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126 run stand with V.V.S. Laxman for the fifth wicket to lead India to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4.[163] He secured the Man of the Match award.[164]
 In the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving India, Sri Lanka and Australia, Tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs.[165] He achieved this feat against Sri Lanka on 5 February 2008 at the Gabba in Brisbane. He started the series wth scores of 10, 35, 44 and 32.[166] His form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament,[original research?] but Tendulkar came back strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls.[167] He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final,[168] and 91 runs in the second final.[169]
 South Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series;[171] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.[172]
 Before the Indian cricket team's tour of Sri Lanka in July 2008, Tendulkar needed 177 runs to go past Brian Lara's record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of 95 runs. India lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three matches.[173]
 In the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury.[174] However, during the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first Test[175] before making 88 in the first innings of the second Test, breaking the record for most number of Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000 run mark when he was on 61.[176][177] He described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record.[178] He made a fifty in the third Test[179] and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2–0 and regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.[180]
 Tendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI[181] and 50 in the fifth,[182] before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India.[183][184]
 England returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first Test, which was originally planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to Chennai following the terror attacks.[183][184] Chasing 387 for victory in that match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh.[185] This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and the first which resulted in a win.[186] He dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks.[187] Tendulkar scored poorly in the second Test at Mohali, which ended in a draw. India won the series 1–0.[188]
 In early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai.[citation needed] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches.[189]
 India's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs. In the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. India made 392, won the match[190] and eventually won the series 3–1.[191] Tendulkar made 160 in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won.[192] He made 49 and 64 in the second Test[193] and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two wickets to win. India won the series 1–0.[194][195]
 Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies,[196] but was back for the Compaq Cup Tri Series between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46[197] and 27[198] in the league matches before notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs.[199] This was Tendulkar's sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals.[200]
 Tendulkar played only one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against Pakistan as India lost.[201] The next match against Australia was abandoned due to rain[202] and he was out with a stomach infection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated.[203]
 Australia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games.[204] In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs.[205] Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs.[206][207] During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs,[207][208] and achieved his personal best against Australia,[209] as well as the third highest score in a defeat.[210]
 In the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches,[211] with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous.[212] India won the series 3–1.[213] In the Test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out in the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third Tests respectively as India clinched innings victories in both the Tests, to win the series 2–0.[214]
 Sachin rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent Test series.[215] He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the Tests.[216][217]
 In the two-Test Series against South Africa, Tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first Test.[218] He then scored 106 in the first innings of the second Test, which was his 47th hundred in Test cricket. It was also his fourth hundred in successive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat.[219][220] In the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world's first batsman to score a double century in ODI cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Zimbabwe's Charles Coventry.[Note 2]
 From February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup. Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament.[226] India defeated Sri Lanka in the final.[227] Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that "Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ... I couldn't control my tears of joy."[228]
 India were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate. He returned to the squad in July for India's tour of England.[233] Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined). However his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side.[234][235] The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed.[234] Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi.[236][237]
 Ian Chappell was not happy with Sachin's performance after India's tour of Australia. He says that Sachin's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia.[238] Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Sachin should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup.[citation needed] Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Sachin has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long.[239]
The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Sachin in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.[240]
 Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup.[241] He became the first person in history to achieve this feat, which was also his first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said "It's been a tough phase for me ... I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99 hundreds."[242] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.[243]
 After being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home,[citation needed] in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.[244]
 However, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012,[245] some people have started to question his place in the Indian team. A report by The Hindustan Times said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs.[246] This speculation, however, was later considered to be false.[247][248]
 Then he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy. He scored 108 in the quarter final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora, where Sachin was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium.[249] Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead.[250] In the semi final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Sachin scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70),[251] and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays.[252] In the final against Saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer.[253] Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13.[254]
 He also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India's 526. This was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling Sunil Gavaskar's Indian record for most first-class hundreds.[255]
 Following poor performance in the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his retirement from One Day Internationals on 23 December 2012, while noting that he will be available for Test cricket.[256][257] In response to the news, former India captain Sourav Ganguly noted that Tendulkar could have played the up-coming series against Pakistan, while Anil Kumble said it would be "tough to see an Indian (ODI) team list without Tendulkar's name in it", and Javagal Srinath mentioned that Tendulkar "changed the way ODIs were played right from the time he opened in New Zealand in 1994".[258]
 After playing a Twenty20 International in 2006 against South Africa, he said that he would not play the format again.[259] He announced his retirement from the IPL after his team, Mumbai Indians, beat Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 26 May to win the Indian Premier League 2013.[30] He retired from Twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket, after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in September–October 2013 in India for Mumbai Indians.[260]
 On 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test series against West Indies in November.[261][262] On his request, the BCCI arranged that the two matches were played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell happened at his home ground.[263][264] He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain Virat Kohli.[31][265] The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport.[266][267] Various national and international figures from cricket, politics, Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long Salaam Sachin Conclave organised by India Today.[268][269]
 In July 2014, he captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.[270]
In December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event.[271][272] It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket world cup 2011.[273][274] So he is heading the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).
 Tendulkar was made the icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008.[275] As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya.[276]
 In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony.[277] Sachin has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.[278]
 Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league. He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.[279]
 In the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored 100 not out off 66 balls. In 51 matches in the IPL Tendulkar has scored 1,723 runs, making him the second-highest run-scorer in the competition's history.[280]
In 2013, Sachin retired from Indian Premier League and currently in 2014 he is appointed as the Mumbai Indian Team's 'Icon'.[281][282][283]
 Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand.[284][285] He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the "most wholesome batsman of his time".[1] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia.[1] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.[286] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that "it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does".[287]Equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batman.[288]
 Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that "Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar."[289][290]
 Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.[291] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.[291] He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that "Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke".[292]
 Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.[293]
 While Tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. He often bowls when two batsmen of the opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can often be a useful partnership breaker.[294] With his bowling, he has helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion.[295] He has taken 201 international wickets – 46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's twelfth highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals.[296]
 Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries.[77] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is "Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God".[297] Cricinfo mentions in his profile that "... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."[1] During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said "I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests."[298] However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said "I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn't."[299] Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself.[300]
 There have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, a person hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century.[301]
 At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to "wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night".[292] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence.[302] Tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt, since May 2010.[303]
 Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs.[1] He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals).[5] He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A and Twenty20). He achieved this feat on 5 October 2013, during a Champions League Twenty20 match for his IPL team Mumbai Indians against Trinidad and Tobago.[304][305][306]
 He also holds the record of the highest number of centuries in both Tests (51) and ODIs (49) as well as in Tests and ODIs combined (100). On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred. It came against Bangladesh in the league matches of Asia Cup 2012.[307] He is also the only player to score fifty centuries in Test cricket,[308] and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined.[citation needed] He also holds the world record for playing the highest number of Test matches (200)[309] and ODI matches (463).[310] Tendulkar has been part of most wins by an Indian in both Test cricket with 72 wins and ODIs with 234 wins and is third in the world in ODI victories after Ricky Ponting (262 wins), Mahela Jayawardene (241 wins).[311][312]
 Tendulkar has scored over 1000 runs in a calendar year in ODIs 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1,894 runs, the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for One-Day Internationals.[310] He is the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket.[223]
 He has been Man of the Match 13 times in Test matches and Man of the Series four times, out of them twice in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.[313] The performances earned him respect from Australian cricket fans and players.[77] Similarly he has been Man of the Match 62 times in One day International matches and Man of the Series 15 times.[310] He became the first batsman to score 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 and 15,000 runs in Test cricket,[citation needed] having also been the third batsman and the first Indian to pass 11,000 runs in that form of the game.[314] He was also the first player to score 10,000 runs in one-day internationals,[315] and also the first player to cross every subsequent 1000-run mark that has been crossed in ODI cricket history.[citation needed] In the fourth Test of the 2008–09 Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia at Nagpur on 6 November 2008, Tendulkar surpassed Australia's Allan Border to become the player to cross the 50-run mark the most number of times in Test cricket history,[316] and also the second ever player to score 11 Test centuries against Australia, tying with Sir Jack Hobbs of England more than 70 years previously.[317] On 8 November 2011, Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in Test Cricket.[318]
 Tendulkar has consistently done well in Cricket World Cups. He was the highest run scorer of the 1996 Cricket World Cup with a total of 523 runs and also of the 2003 Cricket World Cup with 673 runs.[319] After his century against England during group stages of 2011 Cricket World Cup, he became the player to hit most number of centuries in Cricket World Cups with six centuries and the first player to score 2000 runs in World Cup cricket.[320][321]
 On 24 May 1995, Tendulkar married Anjali Mehta (b. 1967), a paediatrician of Gujarati origin, whom he had first met in 1990.[340][341][342][343] They have a daughter Sara and a son Arjun whose skills in cricket as a teenager have been receiving attention.[344][345]
 Tendulkar is a practising Hindu. He is a devotee of the deity Ganesha and was a disciple of the guru Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi, whom he visited on several occasions.[346][347][348] In 1997, Tendulkar captained the Indian National side, playing against a World Eleven team, in the Unity Cup which was held at the Sri Sathya Sai Hill View Stadium in Puttaparthi, in Baba's presence.[349][350] The death of Sai Baba on Tendulkar's 38th birthday caused him to cancel his celebrations.[351][352] The cricketer is also known to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at home and frequently visits temples during night when it is calm and quiet.[353][354]
 Tendulkar's popularity has led him to be a pioneer in India on cricket business dealings when he signed a record sports management deal with WorldTel in 1995, the value of the deal being ₹30 crore (US$4.2 million) over five years.[355][356] His next contract with WorldTel in 2001 was valued at ₹80 crore (US$11 million) over five years.[357] In 2006, he signed a contract with Saatchi and Saatchi's ICONIX valued at ₹180 crore (US$25 million) over three years.[358]
 Tendulkar has opened two restaurants: Tendulkar's[359] (Colaba, Mumbai) and Sachin's[360] (Mulund, Mumbai) and Bangalore. Tendulkar owns these restaurants in partnership with Sanjay Narang of Mars Restaurants.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar co-owns the Kochi ISL team in the Indian Super League Football in association with PVP Ventures owned by Prasad V Potluri. The team has been named as Kerala Blasters after his nickname "Master Blaster".[361][362][363] He also jointly owns the badminton team Bengaluru Blasters which participates in the Premier Badminton League.[citation needed]
 In 2013, Tendulkar was listed at 51st position in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, with his total earnings estimated to be USD 22 million.[364] In October 2013, the net worth of Tendulkar was estimated at USD 160 million by Wealth-X, making him India's wealthiest cricket player.[365][366]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been sponsored by several brands throughout his career including Boost (1990–present),[367] Pepsi (1992–2009),[368] Action Shoes (1995–2000),[369] MRF (1999–2009),[370] Adidas (2000–10), Britannia (2001–07),[371] Fiat Palio (2001–03),[372] TVS (2002–05),[373] ESPN Star Sports (2002–present),[374] Sunfeast (2007–13),[375] Canon (2006–09),[376] Airtel (2004–06),[377] Rorito (2016-),[378] G-Hanz (2005–07),[379] Sanyo BPL (2007–present),[380] Toshiba (2010–present),[381] Colgate-Palmolive,[382] Philips,[382] VISA,[382] Castrol India (2011–12),[383] Ujala Techno Bright,[384] Coca-Cola (2011–13)[385] and Musafir.com (2013–present).[386]
 He has also been a spokesperson for National Egg Coordination Committee (2003–05),[387] AIDS Awareness Campaign (2005)[388] and Luminous India (2010–present).[389]
 In April 2012, Tendulkar accepted the Rajya Sabha nomination proposed by the President of India and became the first active sportsperson and cricketer to have been nominated.[24][390] Former cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar,[391] Ajit Wadekar, Madan Lal[392] expressed their surprise over this move. He took the oath of office on 4 June.[393] He refused to take the bungalow allotted to him in New Delhi calling it "waste of taxpayers' money" as he resides in Mumbai.[394] He met with some controversy over his attendance at Rajya Sabha proceedings.[395] Tendulkar has also been accused of not using the development fund Rajya Sabha members receive.[396]
 Tendulkar sponsors 200 underprivileged children every year through Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based NGO associated with his mother-in-law, Annabel Mehta.[397][398] A request by him on Twitter raised ₹1.02 crore (US$140,000) through Sachin's crusade against cancer for the Crusade against Cancer foundation.[399][400] Sachin Tendulkar spent nine hours on the 12-hour Coca-Cola-NDTV Support My School telethon on 18 September 2011 that helped raise ₹ 7 crore – ₹ 2 crore more than the target – for the creation of basic facilities, particularly toilets for girl students, in 140 government schools across the country.[401]
 Sachin Tendulkar’s autobiography, Playing It My Way, was released on 6 November 2014. It was listed in the 2016 Limca Book of Records for breaking the record for adult hardback pre-publication orders, with 1,50,289 copies confirmed.[402]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been the subject of various books. The following is the listing of books focused on Tendulkar's career:

 Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ ( listen); born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket [5]. Cricket world calls him Little Master or Master Blaster[6][7][8][9] and often referred to as the God of Cricket by Indian cricket followers[10][11]. Despite his reputation, he is known for his modesty and humility, once stating "I am not the God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn’t".[12]
 In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[13] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[14] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[15][16][17]
 Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997, India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth and second highest civilian awards.[18] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[19][20] He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the award.[21][22] He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.[23] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[24] He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force.[25] In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia.[26][27]
 In 2010, Time magazine included Sachin in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most Influential People in the World".[28]
In December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs.[29] He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013[30] and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match, against the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.[31] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[5]
 Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[citation needed] to a Maharashtrian[32][33] Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin family.[34] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[35] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[citation needed][36]
 Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[37] He also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe.[38] To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced the young Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[citation needed]
 Ramakant Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[1] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[39] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[40] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[41] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[39]
 Meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield.[42] Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga League,[39] and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India.[43] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[44] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India.[45] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best junior cricket award" (He was 14 years that time). "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me," Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[46][47] Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[48][49] In his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[50] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India.[51]
 On 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[39] He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[39] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[52] He was handpicked to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium nets,[1] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[53]
 Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Raji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth highest run-scorer overall.[54] He also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.[55] Sachin was picked for a young Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in 1988 and 1989.[56] In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay by two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 deliveries was a key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[57]
 His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[1][58] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[59] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.[60][61][62]
 In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from other English counties.[1][Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.[63]
 Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[64] after one first class season.[65] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[66] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it.[67] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[68] This was later called "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.[69] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.[70][71] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[72][73]
 The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[74] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[75] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match.[67] Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also wrote:[76]
 He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen. Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."[77]
 Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. He opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[78][79] It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.
 Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.[80] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[81]
 After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.[citation needed] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.[82] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.[83]
 This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a Test series.[citation needed] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[citation needed] In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[84] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[85][86] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs.[87] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah – the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[88] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[89]
 Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[90]
 The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[91] In the first match, between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Around 100,000 people came to support India during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record.[92] The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people.[93] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[94] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.[95]
 In the Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory. However, he was out when India needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12 runs.[96] The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.[97] However, he returned to the World Cup scoring a century (140 not out off 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.[98]
 Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",[101] which translates into: "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!".[102]
 Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions.[103] Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award[103] as well as player of the match in one of the games.[104] After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000.[105][106]
 During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. The BCCI President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[107]
 In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team.[108] Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light of alleged ball tampering. Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball.[109] This can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball. Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one Test match ban.[110] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism,[111] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.[112] The charges against Tendulkar and Sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.[113]
 Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001. Tendulkar took the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test. He also take a wicket of Shane Warne.This three wicket change the result of test match from draw to win of India.[114] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.[115]
 In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Sir Donald Bradman's record of 29 Test hundreds.He was awarded by Sports car "Ferrari" by Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat.[116][117][118]
 Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four innings.[119] He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost the series.[120] In this period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin scored his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match.[121][122]
 Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[123] helping India reach the final. While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[124][125]
 He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia.[126][127]  As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final.[128]
 The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spend 613 minute at crease. India have a first inning score of 705/7. He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.[129] Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests.[citation needed] It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.[130][better source needed]
 Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests.[131] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise.[132] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.[133][134] After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.[135]
 A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004.[136][137] He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1.[138]
 On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest[needs update] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.[139] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.[140] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[141] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory.[142] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd,[143] the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century.[citation needed] Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.[144]
 During the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian team coach Greg Chappell. Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the latter felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career.[145] Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media.[146] Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms.[145]
 At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a dismal campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against Bangladesh, 57 not out against Bermuda and 0 against Sri Lanka.[citation needed] As a result, former Australian captain Ian Chappell, brother of Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his newspaper column.[147]
 In the subsequent Test series against Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series.[148] He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs.[149] He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.[150][151]
 On the second day of the Nottingham Test on 28 July 2007, Tendulkar became the third cricketer to complete 11,000 Test runs.[152]
In the subsequent one-day series against England, Tendulkar was the leading run scorer from India[153] with an average of 53.42. In the ODI Series against Australia in October 2007 Tendulkar was the leading Indian run scorer with 278 runs.[154]
 Tendulkar was dismissed seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings.[citation needed] Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career.[155] In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali,[156] and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps.[157]
 In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08, Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run scorer with 493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings.[158] Sachin scored 62 runs in the first innings of the first Test at the MCG in Melbourne, but could not prevent a heavy 337-run win for Australia.[159] In the controversial New Years' Test at Sydney, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 154, even though India lost the Test. This was his third century at the SCG and his 38th Test century overall, earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings.[160][161] In the third Test at the WACA cricket ground in Perth, Sachin was instrumental in India's first innings score of 330, scoring a well-compiled 71. India went on to record a historic triumph at the WACA, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive wins.[162] In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126 run stand with V.V.S. Laxman for the fifth wicket to lead India to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4.[163] He secured the Man of the Match award.[164]
 In the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving India, Sri Lanka and Australia, Tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs.[165] He achieved this feat against Sri Lanka on 5 February 2008 at the Gabba in Brisbane. He started the series wth scores of 10, 35, 44 and 32.[166] His form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament,[original research?] but Tendulkar came back strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls.[167] He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final,[168] and 91 runs in the second final.[169]
 South Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series;[171] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.[172]
 Before the Indian cricket team's tour of Sri Lanka in July 2008, Tendulkar needed 177 runs to go past Brian Lara's record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of 95 runs. India lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three matches.[173]
 In the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury.[174] However, during the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first Test[175] before making 88 in the first innings of the second Test, breaking the record for most number of Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000 run mark when he was on 61.[176][177] He described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record.[178] He made a fifty in the third Test[179] and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2–0 and regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.[180]
 Tendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI[181] and 50 in the fifth,[182] before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India.[183][184]
 England returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first Test, which was originally planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to Chennai following the terror attacks.[183][184] Chasing 387 for victory in that match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh.[185] This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and the first which resulted in a win.[186] He dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks.[187] Tendulkar scored poorly in the second Test at Mohali, which ended in a draw. India won the series 1–0.[188]
 In early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai.[citation needed] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches.[189]
 India's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs. In the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. India made 392, won the match[190] and eventually won the series 3–1.[191] Tendulkar made 160 in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won.[192] He made 49 and 64 in the second Test[193] and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two wickets to win. India won the series 1–0.[194][195]
 Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies,[196] but was back for the Compaq Cup Tri Series between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46[197] and 27[198] in the league matches before notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs.[199] This was Tendulkar's sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals.[200]
 Tendulkar played only one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against Pakistan as India lost.[201] The next match against Australia was abandoned due to rain[202] and he was out with a stomach infection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated.[203]
 Australia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games.[204] In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs.[205] Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs.[206][207] During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs,[207][208] and achieved his personal best against Australia,[209] as well as the third highest score in a defeat.[210]
 In the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches,[211] with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous.[212] India won the series 3–1.[213] In the Test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out in the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third Tests respectively as India clinched innings victories in both the Tests, to win the series 2–0.[214]
 Sachin rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent Test series.[215] He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the Tests.[216][217]
 In the two-Test Series against South Africa, Tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first Test.[218] He then scored 106 in the first innings of the second Test, which was his 47th hundred in Test cricket. It was also his fourth hundred in successive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat.[219][220] In the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world's first batsman to score a double century in ODI cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Zimbabwe's Charles Coventry.[Note 2]
 From February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup. Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament.[226] India defeated Sri Lanka in the final.[227] Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that "Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ... I couldn't control my tears of joy."[228]
 India were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate. He returned to the squad in July for India's tour of England.[233] Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined). However his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side.[234][235] The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed.[234] Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi.[236][237]
 Ian Chappell was not happy with Sachin's performance after India's tour of Australia. He says that Sachin's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia.[238] Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Sachin should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup.[citation needed] Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Sachin has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long.[239]
The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Sachin in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.[240]
 Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup.[241] He became the first person in history to achieve this feat, which was also his first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said "It's been a tough phase for me ... I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99 hundreds."[242] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.[243]
 After being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home,[citation needed] in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.[244]
 However, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012,[245] some people have started to question his place in the Indian team. A report by The Hindustan Times said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs.[246] This speculation, however, was later considered to be false.[247][248]
 Then he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy. He scored 108 in the quarter final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora, where Sachin was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium.[249] Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead.[250] In the semi final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Sachin scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70),[251] and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays.[252] In the final against Saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer.[253] Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13.[254]
 He also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India's 526. This was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling Sunil Gavaskar's Indian record for most first-class hundreds.[255]
 Following poor performance in the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his retirement from One Day Internationals on 23 December 2012, while noting that he will be available for Test cricket.[256][257] In response to the news, former India captain Sourav Ganguly noted that Tendulkar could have played the up-coming series against Pakistan, while Anil Kumble said it would be "tough to see an Indian (ODI) team list without Tendulkar's name in it", and Javagal Srinath mentioned that Tendulkar "changed the way ODIs were played right from the time he opened in New Zealand in 1994".[258]
 After playing a Twenty20 International in 2006 against South Africa, he said that he would not play the format again.[259] He announced his retirement from the IPL after his team, Mumbai Indians, beat Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 26 May to win the Indian Premier League 2013.[30] He retired from Twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket, after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in September–October 2013 in India for Mumbai Indians.[260]
 On 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test series against West Indies in November.[261][262] On his request, the BCCI arranged that the two matches were played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell happened at his home ground.[263][264] He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain Virat Kohli.[31][265] The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport.[266][267] Various national and international figures from cricket, politics, Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long Salaam Sachin Conclave organised by India Today.[268][269]
 In July 2014, he captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.[270]
In December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event.[271][272] It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket world cup 2011.[273][274] So he is heading the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).
 Tendulkar was made the icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008.[275] As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya.[276]
 In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony.[277] Sachin has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.[278]
 Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league. He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.[279]
 In the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored 100 not out off 66 balls. In 51 matches in the IPL Tendulkar has scored 1,723 runs, making him the second-highest run-scorer in the competition's history.[280]
In 2013, Sachin retired from Indian Premier League and currently in 2014 he is appointed as the Mumbai Indian Team's 'Icon'.[281][282][283]
 Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand.[284][285] He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the "most wholesome batsman of his time".[1] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia.[1] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.[286] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that "it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does".[287]Equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batman.[288]
 Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that "Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar."[289][290]
 Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.[291] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.[291] He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that "Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke".[292]
 Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.[293]
 While Tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. He often bowls when two batsmen of the opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can often be a useful partnership breaker.[294] With his bowling, he has helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion.[295] He has taken 201 international wickets – 46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's twelfth highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals.[296]
 Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries.[77] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is "Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God".[297] Cricinfo mentions in his profile that "... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."[1] During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said "I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests."[298] However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said "I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn't."[299] Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself.[300]
 There have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, a person hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century.[301]
 At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to "wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night".[292] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence.[302] Tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt, since May 2010.[303]
 Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs.[1] He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals).[5] He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A and Twenty20). He achieved this feat on 5 October 2013, during a Champions League Twenty20 match for his IPL team Mumbai Indians against Trinidad and Tobago.[304][305][306]
 He also holds the record of the highest number of centuries in both Tests (51) and ODIs (49) as well as in Tests and ODIs combined (100). On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred. It came against Bangladesh in the league matches of Asia Cup 2012.[307] He is also the only player to score fifty centuries in Test cricket,[308] and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined.[citation needed] He also holds the world record for playing the highest number of Test matches (200)[309] and ODI matches (463).[310] Tendulkar has been part of most wins by an Indian in both Test cricket with 72 wins and ODIs with 234 wins and is third in the world in ODI victories after Ricky Ponting (262 wins), Mahela Jayawardene (241 wins).[311][312]
 Tendulkar has scored over 1000 runs in a calendar year in ODIs 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1,894 runs, the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for One-Day Internationals.[310] He is the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket.[223]
 He has been Man of the Match 13 times in Test matches and Man of the Series four times, out of them twice in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.[313] The performances earned him respect from Australian cricket fans and players.[77] Similarly he has been Man of the Match 62 times in One day International matches and Man of the Series 15 times.[310] He became the first batsman to score 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 and 15,000 runs in Test cricket,[citation needed] having also been the third batsman and the first Indian to pass 11,000 runs in that form of the game.[314] He was also the first player to score 10,000 runs in one-day internationals,[315] and also the first player to cross every subsequent 1000-run mark that has been crossed in ODI cricket history.[citation needed] In the fourth Test of the 2008–09 Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia at Nagpur on 6 November 2008, Tendulkar surpassed Australia's Allan Border to become the player to cross the 50-run mark the most number of times in Test cricket history,[316] and also the second ever player to score 11 Test centuries against Australia, tying with Sir Jack Hobbs of England more than 70 years previously.[317] On 8 November 2011, Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in Test Cricket.[318]
 Tendulkar has consistently done well in Cricket World Cups. He was the highest run scorer of the 1996 Cricket World Cup with a total of 523 runs and also of the 2003 Cricket World Cup with 673 runs.[319] After his century against England during group stages of 2011 Cricket World Cup, he became the player to hit most number of centuries in Cricket World Cups with six centuries and the first player to score 2000 runs in World Cup cricket.[320][321]
 On 24 May 1995, Tendulkar married Anjali Mehta (b. 1967), a paediatrician of Gujarati origin, whom he had first met in 1990.[340][341][342][343] They have a daughter Sara and a son Arjun whose skills in cricket as a teenager have been receiving attention.[344][345]
 Tendulkar is a practising Hindu. He is a devotee of the deity Ganesha and was a disciple of the guru Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi, whom he visited on several occasions.[346][347][348] In 1997, Tendulkar captained the Indian National side, playing against a World Eleven team, in the Unity Cup which was held at the Sri Sathya Sai Hill View Stadium in Puttaparthi, in Baba's presence.[349][350] The death of Sai Baba on Tendulkar's 38th birthday caused him to cancel his celebrations.[351][352] The cricketer is also known to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at home and frequently visits temples during night when it is calm and quiet.[353][354]
 Tendulkar's popularity has led him to be a pioneer in India on cricket business dealings when he signed a record sports management deal with WorldTel in 1995, the value of the deal being ₹30 crore (US$4.2 million) over five years.[355][356] His next contract with WorldTel in 2001 was valued at ₹80 crore (US$11 million) over five years.[357] In 2006, he signed a contract with Saatchi and Saatchi's ICONIX valued at ₹180 crore (US$25 million) over three years.[358]
 Tendulkar has opened two restaurants: Tendulkar's[359] (Colaba, Mumbai) and Sachin's[360] (Mulund, Mumbai) and Bangalore. Tendulkar owns these restaurants in partnership with Sanjay Narang of Mars Restaurants.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar co-owns the Kochi ISL team in the Indian Super League Football in association with PVP Ventures owned by Prasad V Potluri. The team has been named as Kerala Blasters after his nickname "Master Blaster".[361][362][363] He also jointly owns the badminton team Bengaluru Blasters which participates in the Premier Badminton League.[citation needed]
 In 2013, Tendulkar was listed at 51st position in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, with his total earnings estimated to be USD 22 million.[364] In October 2013, the net worth of Tendulkar was estimated at USD 160 million by Wealth-X, making him India's wealthiest cricket player.[365][366]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been sponsored by several brands throughout his career including Boost (1990–present),[367] Pepsi (1992–2009),[368] Action Shoes (1995–2000),[369] MRF (1999–2009),[370] Adidas (2000–10), Britannia (2001–07),[371] Fiat Palio (2001–03),[372] TVS (2002–05),[373] ESPN Star Sports (2002–present),[374] Sunfeast (2007–13),[375] Canon (2006–09),[376] Airtel (2004–06),[377] Rorito (2016-),[378] G-Hanz (2005–07),[379] Sanyo BPL (2007–present),[380] Toshiba (2010–present),[381] Colgate-Palmolive,[382] Philips,[382] VISA,[382] Castrol India (2011–12),[383] Ujala Techno Bright,[384] Coca-Cola (2011–13)[385] and Musafir.com (2013–present).[386]
 He has also been a spokesperson for National Egg Coordination Committee (2003–05),[387] AIDS Awareness Campaign (2005)[388] and Luminous India (2010–present).[389]
 In April 2012, Tendulkar accepted the Rajya Sabha nomination proposed by the President of India and became the first active sportsperson and cricketer to have been nominated.[24][390] Former cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar,[391] Ajit Wadekar, Madan Lal[392] expressed their surprise over this move. He took the oath of office on 4 June.[393] He refused to take the bungalow allotted to him in New Delhi calling it "waste of taxpayers' money" as he resides in Mumbai.[394] He met with some controversy over his attendance at Rajya Sabha proceedings.[395] Tendulkar has also been accused of not using the development fund Rajya Sabha members receive.[396]
 Tendulkar sponsors 200 underprivileged children every year through Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based NGO associated with his mother-in-law, Annabel Mehta.[397][398] A request by him on Twitter raised ₹1.02 crore (US$140,000) through Sachin's crusade against cancer for the Crusade against Cancer foundation.[399][400] Sachin Tendulkar spent nine hours on the 12-hour Coca-Cola-NDTV Support My School telethon on 18 September 2011 that helped raise ₹ 7 crore – ₹ 2 crore more than the target – for the creation of basic facilities, particularly toilets for girl students, in 140 government schools across the country.[401]
 Sachin Tendulkar’s autobiography, Playing It My Way, was released on 6 November 2014. It was listed in the 2016 Limca Book of Records for breaking the record for adult hardback pre-publication orders, with 1,50,289 copies confirmed.[402]
 Sachin Tendulkar has been the subject of various books. The following is the listing of books focused on Tendulkar's career:

 Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ ( listen); born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket [5]. Cricket world calls him Little Master or Master Blaster[6][7][8][9] and often referred to as the God of Cricket by Indian cricket followers[10][11]. Despite his reputation, he is known for his modesty and humility, once stating "I am not the God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn’t".[12]
 In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[13] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[14] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[15][16][17]
 Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997, India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth and second highest civilian awards.[18] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[19][20] He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the award.[21][22] He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.[23] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[24] He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force.[25] In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia.[26][27]
 In 2010, Time magazine included Sachin in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most Influential People in the World".[28]
In December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs.[29] He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013[30] and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match, against the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.[31] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[5]
 Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[citation needed] to a Maharashtrian[32][33] Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin family.[34] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[35] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[citation needed][36]
 Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[37] He also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe.[38] To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced the young Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[citation needed]
 Ramakant Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[1] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[39] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[40] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[41] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[39]
 Meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield.[42] Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga League,[39] and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India.[43] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[44] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India.[45] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best junior cricket award" (He was 14 years that time). "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me," Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[46][47] Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[48][49] In his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[50] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India.[51]
 On 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[39] He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[39] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[52] He was handpicked to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium nets,[1] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[53]
 Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Raji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth highest run-scorer overall.[54] He also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.[55] Sachin was picked for a young Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in 1988 and 1989.[56] In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay by two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 deliveries was a key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[57]
 His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[1][58] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[59] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.[60][61][62]
 In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from other English counties.[1][Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.[63]
 Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[64] after one first class season.[65] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[66] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it.[67] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[68] This was later called "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.[69] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.[70][71] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[72][73]
 The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[74] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[75] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match.[67] Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also wrote:[76]
 He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen. Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."[77]
 Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. He opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[78][79] It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.
 Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.[80] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[81]
 After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.[citation needed] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.[82] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.[83]
 This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a Test series.[citation needed] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[citation needed] In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[84] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[85][86] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs.[87] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah – the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[88] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[89]
 Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[90]
 The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[91] In the first match, between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Around 100,000 people came to support India during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record.[92] The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people.[93] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[94] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.[95]
 In the Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory. However, he was out when India needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12 runs.[96] The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.[97] However, he returned to the World Cup scoring a century (140 not out off 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.[98]
 Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",[101] which translates into: "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!".[102]
 Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions.[103] Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award[103] as well as player of the match in one of the games.[104] After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000.[105][106]
 During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. The BCCI President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[107]
 In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team.[108] Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light of alleged ball tampering. Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball.[109] This can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball. Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one Test match ban.[110] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism,[111] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.[112] The charges against Tendulkar and Sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.[113]
 Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001. Tendulkar took the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test. He also take a wicket of Shane Warne.This three wicket change the result of test match from draw to win of India.[114] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.[115]
 In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Sir Donald Bradman's record of 29 Test hundreds.He was awarded by Sports car "Ferrari" by Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat.[116][117][118]
 Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four innings.[119] He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost the series.[120] In this period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin scored his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match.[121][122]
 Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[123] helping India reach the final. While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[124][125]
 He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia.[126][127]  As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final.[128]
 The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spend 613 minute at crease. India have a first inning score of 705/7. He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.[129] Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests.[citation needed] It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.[130][better source needed]
 Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests.[131] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise.[132] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.[133][134] After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.[135]
 A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004.[136][137] He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1.[138]
 On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest[needs update] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.[139] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.[140] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[141] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory.[142] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd,[143] the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.[citation needed]
 Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century.[citation needed] Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.[144]
 During the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian team coach Greg Chappell. Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the latter felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career.[145] Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media.[146] Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms.[145]
 At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a dismal campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against Bangladesh, 57 not out against Bermuda and 0 against Sri Lanka.[citation needed] As a result, former Australian captain Ian Chappell, brother of Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his newspaper column.[147]
 In the subsequent Test series against Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series.[148] He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs.[149] He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.[150][151]
 On the second day of the Nottingham Test on 28 July 2007, Tendulkar became the third cricketer to complete 11,000 Test runs.[152]
In the subsequent one-day series against England, Tendulkar was the leading run scorer from India[153] with an average of 53.42. In the ODI Series against Australia in October 2007 Tendulkar was the leading Indian run scorer with 278 runs.[154]
 Tendulkar was dismissed seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings.[citation needed] Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career.[155] In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali,[156] and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps.[157]
 In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08, Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run scorer with 493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings.[158] Sachin scored 62 runs in the first innings of the first Test at the MCG in Melbourne, but could not prevent a heavy 337-run win for Australia.[159] In the controversial New Years' Test at Sydney, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 154, even though India lost the Test. This was his third century at the SCG and his 38th Test century overall, earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings.[160][161] In the third Test at the WACA cricket ground in Perth, Sachin was instrumental in India's first innings score of 330, scoring a well-compiled 71. India went on to record a historic triumph at the WACA, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive wins.[162] In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126 run stand with V.V.S. Laxman for the fifth wicket to lead India to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4.[163] He secured the Man of the Match award.[164]
 In the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving India, Sri Lanka and Australia, Tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs.[165] He achieved this feat against Sri Lanka on 5 February 2008 at the Gabba in Brisbane. He started the series wth scores of 10, 35, 44 and 32.[166] His form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament,[original research?] but Tendulkar came back strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls.[167] He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final,[168] and 91 runs in the second final.[169]
 South Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series;[171] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.[172]
 Before the Indian cricket team's tour of Sri Lanka in July 2008, Tendulkar needed 177 runs to go past Brian Lara's record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of 95 runs. India lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three matches.[173]
 In the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury.[174] However, during the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first Test[175] before making 88 in the first innings of the second Test, breaking the record for most number of Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000 run mark when he was on 61.[176][177] He described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record.[178] He made a fifty in the third Test[179] and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2–0 and regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.[180]
 Tendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI[181] and 50 in the fifth,[182] before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India.[183][184]
 England returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first Test, which was originally planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to Chennai following the terror attacks.[183][184] Chasing 387 for victory in that match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh.[185] This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and the first which resulted in a win.[186] He dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks.[187] Tendulkar scored poorly in the second Test at Mohali, which ended in a draw. India won the series 1–0.[188]
 In early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai.[citation needed] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches.[189]
 India's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs. In the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. India made 392, won the match[190] and eventually won the series 3–1.[191] Tendulkar made 160 in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won.[192] He made 49 and 64 in the second Test[193] and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two wickets to win. India won the series 1–0.[194][195]
 Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies,[196] but was back for the Compaq Cup Tri Series between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46[197] and 27[198] in the league matches before notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs.[199] This was Tendulkar's sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals.[200]
 Tendulkar played only one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against Pakistan as India lost.[201] The next match against Australia was abandoned due to rain[202] and he was out with a stomach infection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated.[203]
 Australia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games.[204] In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs.[205] Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs.[206][207] During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs,[207][208] and achieved his personal best against Australia,[209] as well as the third highest score in a defeat.[210]
 In the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches,[211] with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous.[212] India won the series 3–1.[213] In the Test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out in the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third Tests respectively as India clinched innings victories in both the Tests, to win the series 2–0.[214]
 Sachin rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent Test series.[215] He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the Tests.[216][217]
 In the two-Test Series against South Africa, Tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first Test.[218] He then scored 106 in the first innings of the second Test, which was his 47th hundred in Test cricket. It was also his fourth hundred in successive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat.[219][220] In the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world's first batsman to score a double century in ODI cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Zimbabwe's Charles Coventry.[Note 2]
 From February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup. Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament.[226] India defeated Sri Lanka in the final.[227] Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that "Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ... I couldn't control my tears of joy."[228]
 India were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate. He returned to the squad in July for India's tour of England.[233] Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined). However his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side.[234][235] The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed.[234] Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi.[236][237]
 Ian Chappell was not happy with Sachin's performance after India's tour of Australia. He says that Sachin's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia.[238] Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Sachin should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup.[citation needed] Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Sachin has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long.[239]
The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Sachin in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.[240]
 Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup.[241] He became the first person in history to achieve this feat, which was also his first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said "It's been a tough phase for me ... I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99 hundreds."[242] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.[243]
 After being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home,[citation needed] in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.[244]
 However, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012,[245] some people have started to question his place in the Indian team. A report by The Hindustan Times said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs.[246] This speculation, however, was later considered to be false.[247][248]
 Then he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy. He scored 108 in the quarter final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora, where Sachin was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium.[249] Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead.[250] In the semi final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Sachin scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70),[251] and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays.[252] In the final against Saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer.[253] Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13.[254]
 He also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India's 526. This was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling Sunil Gavaskar's Indian record for most first-class hundreds.[255]
 Following poor performance in the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his retirement from One Day Internationals on 23 December 2012, while noting that he will be available for Test cricket.[256][257] In response to the news, former India captain Sourav Ganguly noted that Tendulkar could have played the up-coming series against Pakistan, while Anil Kumble said it would be "tough to see an Indian (ODI) team list without Tendulkar's name in it", and Javagal Srinath mentioned that Tendulkar "changed the way ODIs were played right from the time he opened in New Zealand in 1994".[258]
 After playing a Twenty20 International in 2006 against South Africa, he said that he would not play the format again.[259] He announced his retirement from the IPL after his team, Mumbai Indians, beat Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 26 May to win the Indian Premier League 2013.[30] He retired from Twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket, after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in September–October 2013 in India for Mumbai Indians.[260]
 On 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test series against West Indies in November.[261][262] On his request, the BCCI arranged that the two matches were played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell happened at his home ground.[263][264] He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain Virat Kohli.[31][265] The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport.[266][267] Various national and international figures from cricket, politics, Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long Salaam Sachin Conclave organised by India Today.[268][269]
 In July 2014, he captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.[270]
In December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event.[271][272] It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket world cup 2011.[273][274] So he is heading the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).
 Tendulkar was made the icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008.[275] As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya.[276]
 In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony.[277] Sachin has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.[278]
 Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league. He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.[279]
 In the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored 100 not out off 66 balls. In 51 matches in the IPL Tendulkar has scored 1,723 runs, making him the second-highest run-scorer in the competition's history.[280]
In 2013, Sachin retired from Indian Premier League and currently in 2014 he is appointed as the Mumbai Indian Team's 'Icon'.[281][282][283]
 Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand.[284][285] He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the "most wholesome batsman of his time".[1] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia.[1] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.[286] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that "it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does".[287]Equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batman.[288]
 Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that "Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar."[289][290]
 Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.[291] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.[291] He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that "Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke".[292]
 Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.[293]
 While Tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. He often bowls when two batsmen of the opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can often be a useful partnership breaker.[294] With his bowling, he has helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion.[295] He has taken 201 international wickets – 46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's twelfth highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals.[296]
 Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries.[77] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is "Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God".[297] Cricinfo mentions in his profile that "... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."[1] During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said "I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests."[298] However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said "I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn't."[299] Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself.[300]
 There have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, a person hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century.[301]
 At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to "wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night".[292] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence.[302] Tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt, since May 2010.[303]
 Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs.[1] He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals).[5] He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A and Twenty20). He achieved this feat on 5 October 2013, during a Champions League Twenty20 match for his IPL team Mumbai Indians against Trinidad and Tobago.[304][305][306]
 He also holds the record of the highest number of centuries in both Tests (51) and ODIs (49) as well as in Tests and ODIs combined (100). On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred. It came against Bangladesh in the league matches of Asia Cup 2012.[307] He is also the only player to score fifty centuries in Test cricket,[308] and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined.[citation needed] He also holds the world record for playing the highest number of Test matches (200)[309] and ODI matches (463).[310] Tendulkar has been part of most wins by an Indian in both Test cricket with 72 wins and ODIs with 234 wins and is third in the world in ODI victories after Ricky Ponting (262 wins), Mahela Jayawardene (241 wins).[311][312]
 Tendulkar has scored over 1000 runs in a calendar year in ODIs 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1,894 runs, the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for One-Day Internationals.[310] He is the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket.[223]
 He has been Man of the Match 13 times in Test matches and Man of the Series four times, out of them twice in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.[313] The performances earned him respect from Australian cricket fans and players.[77] Similarly he has been Man of the Match 62 times in One day International matches and Man of the Series 15 times.[310] He became the first batsman to score 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 and 15,000 runs in Test cricket,[citation needed] having also been the third batsman and the first Indian to pass 11,000 runs in that form of the game.[314] He was also the first player to score 10,000 runs in one-day internationals,[315] and also the first player to cross every subsequent 1000-run mark that has been crossed in ODI cricket history.[citation needed] In the fourth Test of the 2008–09 Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia at Nagpur on 6 November 2008, Tendulkar surpassed Australia's Allan Border to become the player to cross the 50-run mark the most number of times in Test cricket history,[316] and also the second ever player to score 11 Test centuries against Australia, tying with Sir Jack Hobbs of England more than 70 years previously.[317] On 8 November 2011, Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in Test Cricket.[318]
 Tendulkar has consistently done well in Cricket World Cups. He was the highest run scorer of the 1996 Cricket World Cup with a total of 523 runs and also of the 2003 Cricket World Cup with 673 runs.[319] After his century against England during group stages of 2011 Cricket World Cup, he became the player to hit most number of centuries in Cricket World Cups with six centuries and the first player to score 2000 runs in World Cup cricket.[320][321]
 On 24 May 1995, Tendulkar married Anjali Mehta (b. 1967), a paediatrician of Gujarati origin, whom he had first met in 1990.[340][341][342][343] They have a daughter Sara and a son Arjun whose skills in cricket as a teenager have been receiving attention.[344][345]

He is a devotee of the deity Ganesha and was a disciple of the guru Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi, whom he visited on several occasions.[346][347][348] In 1997, Tendulkar captained the Indian National side, playing against a World Eleven team, in the Unity Cup which was held at the Sri Sathya Sai Hill View Stadium in Puttaparthi, in Baba's presence.[349][350] The death of Sai Baba on Tendulkar's 38th birthday caused him to cancel his celebrations.[351][352] The cricketer is also known to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at home and frequently visits temples during night when it is calm and quiet.[353][354]
 Tendulkar's popularity has led him to be a pioneer in India on cricket business dealings when he signed a record sports management deal with WorldTel in 1995, the value of the deal being ₹30 crore (US$4.2 million) over five years.[355][356] His next contract with WorldTel in 2001 was valued at ₹80 crore (US$11 million) over five years.[357] In 2006, he signed a contract with Saatchi and Saatchi's ICONIX valued at ₹180 crore (US$25 million) over three years.[358]

 In 2013, Tendulkar was listed at 51st position in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, with his total earnings estimated to be USD 22 million.[364] In October 2013, the net worth of Tendulkar was estimated at USD 160 million by Wealth-X, making him India's wealthiest cricket player.[365][366]

 In April 2012, Tendulkar accepted the Rajya Sabha nomination proposed by the President of India and became the first active sportsperson and cricketer to have been nominated.[24][390] Former cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar,[391] Ajit Wadekar, Madan Lal[392] expressed their surprise over this move. He took the oath of office on 4 June.[393] He refused to take the bungalow allotted to him in New Delhi calling it "waste of taxpayers' money" as he resides in Mumbai.[394] He met with some controversy over his attendance at Rajya Sabha proceedings.[395] Tendulkar has also been accused of not using the development fund Rajya Sabha members receive.[396]
 Tendulkar sponsors 200 underprivileged children every year through Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based NGO associated with his mother-in-law, Annabel Mehta.[397][398] A request by him on Twitter raised ₹1.02 crore (US$140,000) through Sachin's crusade against cancer for the Crusade against Cancer foundation.[399][400] Sachin Tendulkar spent nine hours on the 12-hour Coca-Cola-NDTV Support My School telethon on 18 September 2011 that helped raise ₹ 7 crore – ₹ 2 crore more than the target – for the creation of basic facilities, particularly toilets for girl students, in 140 government schools across the country.[401]

 Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured,[1][2] similar to data mining.
 Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science.
 Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.[4][5] In 2012, when Harvard Business Review called it "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century",[6] the term "data science" became a buzzword.  It is now often used interchangeably with earlier concepts like business analytics,[7] business intelligence, predictive modeling, and statistics.  Even the suggestion that data science is sexy was paraphrasing Hans Rosling, featured in a 2011 BBC documentary with the quote, "Statistics is now the sexiest subject around."[8] Nate Silver referred to data science as a sexed up term for statistics.[9]   In many cases, earlier approaches and solutions are now simply rebranded as "data science" to be more attractive, which can cause the term to become "dilute[d] beyond usefulness."[10] While many university programs now offer a data science degree, there exists no consensus on a definition or suitable curriculum contents.[7] To its discredit, however, many data-science and big-data projects fail to deliver useful results, often as a result of poor management and utilization of resources.[11][12][13][14] The term "data science" has appeared in various contexts over the past thirty years but did not become an established term until recently. In an early usage, it was used as a substitute for computer science by Peter Naur in 1960. Naur later introduced the term "datalogy".[15] In 1974, Naur published Concise Survey of Computer Methods, which freely used the term data science in its survey of the contemporary data processing methods that are used in a wide range of applications.
 In 1996, members of the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS) met in Kobe for their biennial conference. Here, for the first time, the term data science is included in the title of the conference ("Data Science, classification, and related methods"),[16] after the term was introduced in a roundtable discussion by Chikio Hayashi.[3] In November 1997, C.F. Jeff Wu gave the inaugural lecture entitled "Statistics = Data Science?"[17] for his appointment to the H. C. Carver Professorship at the University of Michigan.[18]
In this lecture, he characterized statistical work as a trilogy of data collection, data modeling and analysis, and decision making. In his conclusion,
he initiated the modern, non-computer science, usage of the term "data science" and advocated that statistics be renamed data science and statisticians data scientists.[17]
Later, he presented his lecture entitled "Statistics = Data Science?" as the first of his 1998 P.C. Mahalanobis Memorial Lectures.[19] These lectures honor Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, an Indian scientist and statistician and founder of the Indian Statistical Institute.
 In 2001, William S. Cleveland introduced data science as an independent discipline, extending the field of statistics to incorporate "advances in computing with data" in his article "Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics," which was published in Volume 69, No. 1, of the April 2001 edition of the International Statistical Review / Revue Internationale de Statistique.[20] In his report, Cleveland establishes six technical areas which he believed to encompass the field of data science: multidisciplinary investigations, models and methods for data, computing with data, pedagogy, tool evaluation, and theory.
 In April 2002, the International Council for Science (ICSU): Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA)[21] started the Data Science Journal,[22] a publication focused on issues such as the description of data systems, their publication on the internet, applications and legal issues.[23] Shortly thereafter, in January 2003, Columbia University began publishing The Journal of Data Science,[24] which provided a platform for all data workers to present their views and exchange ideas. The journal was largely devoted to the application of statistical methods and quantitative research. In 2005, The National Science Board published "Long-lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century" defining data scientists as "the information and computer scientists, database and software and programmers, disciplinary experts, curators and expert annotators, librarians, archivists, and others, who are crucial to the successful management of a digital data collection" whose primary activity is to "conduct creative inquiry and analysis."[25] Around 2007,[citation needed] Turing award winner Jim Gray envisioned "data-driven science" as a "fourth paradigm" of science that uses the computational analysis of large data as primary scientific method[4][5] and "to have a world in which all of the science literature is online, all of the science data is online, and they interoperate with each other."[26] In the 2012 Harvard Business Review article "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century",[6] DJ Patil claims to have coined this term in 2008 with Jeff Hammerbacher to define their jobs at LinkedIn and Facebook, respectively. He asserts that a data scientist is "a new breed", and that a "shortage of data scientists is becoming a serious constraint in some sectors", but describes a much more business-oriented role.
 In 2013, the IEEE Task Force on Data Science and Advanced Analytics[27] was launched. In 2013, the first "European Conference on Data Analysis (ECDA)" was organised in Luxembourg, establishing the European Association for Data Science (EuADS). The first international conference: IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics was launched in 2014.[28] In 2014, General Assembly launched student-paid bootcamp and The Data Incubator launched a competitive free data science fellowship.[29]  In 2014, the American Statistical Association section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining renamed its journal to "Statistical Analysis and Data Mining: The ASA Data Science Journal" and in 2016 changed its section name to "Statistical Learning and Data Science".[30]  In 2015, the International Journal on Data Science and Analytics[31] was launched by Springer to publish original work on data science and big data analytics.  In September 2015 the Gesellschaft für Klassifikation (GfKl) added to the name of the Society "Data Science Society" at the third ECDA conference at the University of Essex, Colchester, UK.
 The popularity of the term "data science" has exploded in business environments and academia, as indicated by a jump in job openings.[32] However, many critical academics and journalists see no distinction between data science and statistics. Writing in Forbes, Gil Press argues that data science is a buzzword without a clear definition and has simply replaced “business analytics” in contexts such as graduate degree programs.[7] In the question-and-answer section of his keynote address at the Joint Statistical Meetings of American Statistical Association, noted applied statistician Nate Silver said, “I think data-scientist is a sexed up term for a statistician....Statistics is a branch of science. Data scientist is slightly redundant in some way and people shouldn’t berate the term statistician.”[9] Similarly, in business sector, multiple researchers and analysts state that data scientists alone are far from being sufficient in granting companies a real competitive advantage[33] and consider data scientists as only one of the four greater job families companies require to leverage big data effectively, namely: data analysts, data scientists, big data developers and big data engineers.[34] On the other hand, responses to criticism are as numerous. In a 2014 Wall Street Journal article, Irving Wladawsky-Berger compares the data science enthusiasm with the dawn of computer science. He argues data science, like any other interdisciplinary field, employs methodologies and practices from across the academia and industry, but then it will morph them into a new discipline. He brings to attention the sharp criticisms computer science, now a well respected academic discipline, had to once face.[35] Likewise, NYU Stern's Vasant Dhar, as do many other academic proponents of data science,[35] argues more specifically in December 2013 that data science is different from the existing practice of data analysis across all disciplines, which focuses only on explaining data sets. Data science seeks actionable and consistent pattern for predictive uses.[1]  This practical engineering goal takes data science beyond traditional analytics. Now the data in those disciplines and applied fields that lacked solid theories, like health science and social science, could be sought and utilized to generate powerful predictive models.[1] In an effort similar to Dhar's, Stanford professor David Donoho, in September 2015, takes the proposition further by rejecting three simplistic and misleading definitions of data science in lieu of criticisms.[36] First, for Donoho, data science does not equate to big data, in that the size of the data set is not a criterion to distinguish data science and statistics.[36] Second, data science is not defined by the computing skills of sorting big data sets, in that these skills are already generally used for analyses across all disciplines.[36] Third, data science is a heavily applied field where academic programs right now do not sufficiently prepare data scientists for the jobs, in that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data science program.[36][37] As a statistician, Donoho, following many in his field, champions the broadening of learning scope in the form of data science,[36] like John Chambers who urges statisticians to adopt an inclusive concept of learning from data,[38] or like William Cleveland who urges to prioritize extracting from data applicable predictive tools over explanatory theories.[20] Together, these statisticians envision an increasingly inclusive applied field that grows out of traditional statistics and beyond.
 For the future of data science, Donoho projects an ever-growing environment for open science where data sets used for academic publications are accessible to all researchers.[36] US National Institute of Health has already announced plans to enhance reproducibility and transparency of research data.[39] Other big journals are likewise following suit.[40][41] This way, the future of data science not only exceeds the boundary of statistical theories in scale and methodology, but data science will revolutionize current academia and research paradigms.[36] As Donoho concludes, "the scope and impact of data science will continue to expand enormously in coming decades as scientific data and data about science itself become ubiquitously available."[36]

These functions correspond to the methods of the abstract class POM Application Object.The prototypes for these functions are in aom.h.It is suggested that AOM be used by code using Teamcenter Engineering supplied classes (i.e., datasets, Items, etc.) and POM be used directly when dealing with your extensions to the schema.For example, a Form can use a POM class to store the data. Any searches or reports against the same must be done through POM since the AOM only loads classes known to the C++ encapsulation. This layer cannot be user-extended at present.Also, the POM should not be used directly against AOM loaded classes since the correspondence between the POM object and its C++ encapsulation can be broken (with unpredictable results).RESTRICTION These functions do not work with tags to instances of classes that are subclasses of POM_system_class(i.e., Groups, Users, and GroupMembers). ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -Confidential2) Teamcenter Engineering Classification System (TECS)Classification of your company's product data -standard parts, technology data, manufacturing equipment -saves time by making component data easier to find and retrieve and reduces costs by allowing you to reuse existing parts and consolidate and/or eliminate duplicate or out-dated parts. Teamcenter Engineering Classification is used to create and maintain a hierarchical classification structure based on the attribute values of your Teamcenter Engineering workspace objects.You will use ICS-ITK to:·Add items to the classification hierarchy·Classify workspace objects·Find and retrieve Instances of objects·Modify the attribute values of classification Instances·Delete instances from the classification hierarchy ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -Confidential3) Folder Manager Module (FL)functions allow you to organize your Teamcenter Engineering data using a familiar folder metaphor.The first argument of the functions in this interface is usually the tag of the folder to be operated upon. Input arguments always precede output arguments. Therefore, in the case of create, the tag is the last argument.This module implements the methods of class Folder. The operations you can perform on a folder are:·Insert objects into a folder·Remove objects from a folderMove objects in a folder (e.g., sort the objects) ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -Confidential4) Application Encapsulation Module (AE):Application Encapsulation serves four primary purposes:1. It allows the system to present a direct means of dealing with objects of interest to the end user. An end user may be a design engineer, in which case the objects of interest for the task at hand may include drawings, CAD models, and analysis data. Dealing directly with these objects is preferable to learning the details of the computer environment and to preparing the computer environment needed to access objects in the system. ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -Confidential2. It provides the system administrator with means of controlling access, managing storage, and specifying applications that may be used to generate different types of data at the site in consideration.3. It provides the system integrator with a set of functions that enable data sharing and making apparently unrelated applications part of a consistent whole. This set of functions will be used by applications designed with Teamcenter Engineering in mind and will also assist an integrator in writing application encapsulation shells for existing applications. ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -Confidential4. It provides a consistent revisioningmechanism for objects managed by Teamcenter Engineering. The Application Encapsulation (AE) ITK provides access to revisions of Teamcenter Engineering supplied objects, namely datasets, and it exposes the low level revisioningmechanism so that ITK programmers can develop their own classes with revisioningbehavior.This module maintains four classes of objects.Datasets:A dataset will contain information such as the creating application in addition to all of the standard set of information about Workspace objects. It will also specify location information and site designated dataset classification information. Site designated dataset classification, which is merely a string of characters to Teamcenter Engineering, allow users to classify a dataset, for example as "Sketch" or "Trip Report", according to their conventions.The dataset interface should be robust enough for most applications, such that you should probably not need to ever deal directly with revision anchors. To do this, some implicit refreshing and saving of revision anchors takes place that you must be aware of if you do work with revision anchors. In particular, "create," "purge," "delete,""delete_all," and "revise" all load the revision anchor for modify if it has not already been so loaded.Therefore, you should not do it, or you may lose other edits that occur in your session. "Purge," "delete," and "save" will all save the revision anchor.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialŁDataset TypesObjects of this class contain data that describe the informationin datasets. This data includes the set of applications, or Tools, that may be used in creating a dataset of this type.Itis possible to register a DatasetTypefor specific workspace actions. If the action is registered for a DatasetType, then Teamcenter Engineering invokes the appropriate tool whenever that action is chosen for datasets of that type. If the action is not registered, then thedefault Teamcenter Engineering behavior occurs and no tool is called.Bydefault, when a dataset is created the actions "create," "open,""open using," and "print" are registered. These can be unregistered and additional actions can be registered as desired. The defaultTeamcenter Engineering behavior for actions is as follows:5) Enterprise Process Management (EPM):Functions provide you with the capability to write action and rule handler code. You must include the header file epm.hin your source code. ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialŁ6) Preference Module:Teamcenter Engineering has implemented preferences functions that allows users to customize the operating environment.Detailed information is supplied for the following aspects of preferences functions:The location of preference files, and the precedence rules employed in reading and writing to them.The syntax of preference codes and values.The Preference codes currently defined for preferences in Teamcenter Engineering.Teamcenter Engineering makes use of this mechanism itself, and it also provides ITK level functions for programmers to make use of the same preference mechanism. Programmers can define their own preference codes if they wish, or they can read and write to existing Teamcenter Engineering preferences.If you intend to add new preference codes, we suggest that you prefix them with your company name, thus ensuring that they will not conflict with anypreference codes that Teamcenter Engineering may implement in the future.The ITK preference functions include:An initialization functionA function to inquire on the number of values a specified preference code hasFunctions to read and write values of a specified preference code.Functions to inquire and set the preference search scope (this allows programs to force a search of, for example, only the site preference file) ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialŁ7) BOM Editor Function:Part of the BOM module that traverses selected parts of a BOM Window, in order to produce an output file in a defined format. In order to easily combine different behaviors, parameters are passed to BOM_writer_write_bomwindow() via structures allocated with BOM_writer_new_, rather than the normal function call mechanism.Structures should be de allocated using BOM_writer_delete.This input-parameter structure approach also provides future proofing: where possible, enhancements will be added to these structures with backward-compatible defaults to permit existing code to continue to function.8) RDVThis module provides an interface to common RDV functions, such as creating and manipulating RDV contexts, searching for instances within an RDV context, andinterpreting search results. These functions correspond to the functionality provided in the DesignContextapplication in Teamcenter Engineering and the View In Context functionality in Web Access.The prototypes for these functions are in rdv.h.The traverse engine module presents an interface that allows developing programs that do traversal of Teamcenter Engineering structures.The calls will allow you to:·Initialize traversing by setting the top root (this involves PSconfiguration for PS Traversal)·Register different handlers (possibly associating with Node type)·Start traversal·Retrieve node information·Store, retrieve and process node information·Obtain preferences from configuration file·Display messages to console and log file, to give warnings etc ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialŁ9) Product Structure Management:There are three modules associated with managing product structure:1. Bill of Materials (BOM) ModuleThe BOM module operates at the highest level; below the PSE userinterface and above the PS module. It is oriented toward the presentation of and interaction with Product Structure and encompasses the application of Configuration Rules.The BOM module is used for general operations, such as creating reports and editing structure. It pulls together information from Items, Item Revisions, BOMViewRevisions and Occurrences in order to present them as entries in a Bill of Materials.2. Product Structure (PS) ModuleThe PS module handles product structure operations at a lower level. It is also responsible for the creation and manipulation of the basic structure objects (i.e., BOMViewsand Occurrences).This module is most useful for large scale import of structure data into Teamcenter Engineering or batch operation to update specific structure attributes (where the overhead of building up the full presentation of BOM-related information is not required).3. Configuration Management (CFM) ModuleThe CFM module allows configuration rules to be specified, determining which revision of an Item is loaded. These rules can be named and are referred to as Preset Configuration Rules.10. Generic Relationship Manager (GRM) ModuleThe GRM module supports the concept of explicit relationships. Adataset can be directly and explicitly related to an Item Revision with, as an example, a specification relationship. With GRM, you can define and enforce specific rules pertaining to relationships, as well as separate the maintenance of relationships from the data itself. ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialWhat is TAG_T?Tag_t!!??February 27, 200921©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialIntegration Toolkit Part 2©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialTag_tData TypeŁEach object in the database has a unique identifier (UID attribute in a database table).ŁAs an object is loaded into memory with an ITK program it is identified via a dynamic tag.ŁDatabase objects created under the class Persistent Object Manager (POM_object) are represented by the type tag_tjust as integers have the type int.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialMemory ManagementWhen > Where >HowFebruary 27, 200923©2008 Wipro Ltd  -Confidential©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialŁFrequently memory is allocated by a Teamcenter function and returned to the caller in a pointer variable.ŁThis is indicated in the interface by the  /* <OF> */ following the argument definition.ŁThis memory should be freed by passing the address to MEM_free.»Void MEM_free( void * pointer /* <I> */ );ŁContents of the storage becomes undefined after the call to this function.Memory Management©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialError message handlingWhen > Where >HowFebruary 27, 200925©2008 Wipro Ltd  -Confidential©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialŁMost ITK functions return integer values when an error occurs.

In many cases, the application failure that occurs in a Customer™s environment cannot be reproduced in a development environment. There are many factors that attribute to this. Windows applications are used for many different purposes, and in some cases, they interact with many external systems, such as a database server, a device or another computer. The systems on which our application depends on introduce a number of variables which might not have been identified during the development. Or, a bug in those external systems might cause Windows application to fail. The next few slides attempts to put together some of the good practices that will be handy when debugging any Windows Applications when they encounter runtime errors at the customer sites.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialWhen to do debugging??ŁDebugging during coding: Proactive CodingŁDebugging during system testing and integration.ŁDebugging Release Binaries (Field defects or Post Release Defects)©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialBuild ConfigurationsŁBuild using Debug mode ŁBuild using Release ModeŁWe can also have Custom Mode of building a library or executable.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialDebugDebug: In this configuration, the code is not optimized (/Od) by default. The binary output will have the required debugging information so that the application can be debugged easily using the IDE. This configuration is mainly used during development stage.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialReleaseRelease: In this configuration, the code is highly optimized (/O2) by default. The size of the output binary will be much lesser when compared to that of the Debug build. The binary output file will not have any kind of debug information associated with it. Generally, this configuration is what is finally shipped to the customer.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialWhat is windows application?? ŁWindows applications are user mode applications developed mostly using Visual Studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment). These applications may or may not use MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes). These applications may or may not have a User interface. They could be getting user inputs through a console window (Console application or Win32 application) or they could be having a sophisticated user interface for prompting user to provide the necessary inputs for its operation. ŁEaxamples: TC DLLs and EXEs.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialWhen to give a release mode??ŁThe release build configuration is the generally preferred for generating binaries that can be deployed to the end user. All the Windows operating system versions are shipped with the Release built MFC and Run-time libraries. If the developer wants to ship a Debug built library to the end user, he has to necessarily redistribute the Debug versions of MFC and/or Run-time libraries in order for the application to run. Because of this, it has been a general practice to only ship the releaseconfiguration built version of the application to the end user.ŁIn addition to above factor, release builds offer the following:ŁReduced binary sizeŁHighly optimized binaries/librariesŁStricter memory allocationŁVoid of run-time checksŁWith the above set of additional factors, it really becomes a tough job to debug problems that occur at a customer site. ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialDealing with Release mode DLL crashes.ŁApplication may crash for many reasons. Among them, the most common are runtime errors, which may be caused by illegal address reference, scarce resources or memory etc. In Windows environment, applications may crash because, some part of the application threw an exception which was not handled at all.ŁWhen your application crashes at a customer™s PC, it is almost impossible to debug it right away. Customer PCs will not be accessible for the developers to perform any debugging. On many occasions, what will be required is just a stack trace. There are quite a few ways to get the required information from the customer system.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialHow to do debugging?ŁProactive CodingŁUsing Debugging ToolsŁPrerequisites?ŒPDB and DBG files, what are they?ŒKnow the faulty environment.ŒSymbol Setup.ŒUser mode? Kernel mode? Choose a suitable tool.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialPDB and DBG filesŁThe .PDB extension stands for "program database." It stores debugging information and other project state information. One of the most important motivations for it was to allow incremental linking of debug versions of programsŁThe .DBG extension stands for "debug." The .DBG files created with the 32-bit NT toolset are in the Portable Executable (PE) file format. They contain sections with COFF, FPO, and in some cases Codeviewinformation. The Visual C++ integrated debugger can read .DBG files in this format; however it ignores the COFF symbol sections and looks for Codeviewinformation. ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialHow to generate PDB files??ŁIn MSDev, click Project Settings for the release configuration. ŁClick C++ tab, under the category General, under Debug info, select Program Database (the corresponding compiler switch is /Zi). ŁClick the Link tab, under the category General, select Generate debug info (the corresponding linker switch is /debug). Make sure that "Use program database" is selected on the Link tab, category Customize (the corresponding linker switch is similar to the following: Ł/pdb:"Release/myproject.pdb" ). ŁOn the Link tab, in the Project Options box, append the following: Ł/OPT:ICF /OPT:REF ŁRebuild your application. ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialDBG files?? How to generate that??ŁThe Visual C++ integrated debugger can also use .DBG files as long as they are made from a binary containing Codeviewformat debugging output. These are useful for debugging when the source code is not available. Even without the source, .DBG files allow you to set breakpoints on functions, watch variables, and see the functions in the callstack. They are also required for OLE RPC debugging. One caveat needs to be pointed out: when working with symbols from a .DBG file, you must use the fully decorated names. For example, to set a breakpoint on a call to the Windows sndPlaySoundfunction, you would specify _sndPlaySoundA@8 as the location. For 32-bit .EXEs, the Visual C++ version 2.x and 4.x debugger's symbol handler reads the format used in the Windows NT .DBG files, supplied for use with its system .DLL files. These .DBG files are in the Portable Executable (PE) file format and contain sections with COFF, FPO,and in some cases Codeviewsymbolic information. The new Visual C++ debugger reads .DBG files in this format only. Furthermore, it only uses the Codeviewinformation, ignoring the other symbol sections. It is possible to strip debug information from a PE file and store it in a .DBG file for use by debuggers. For this to work, the debugger needs to know whether to find the debug information in a separate file or not and whether the information has been stripped from the file or not. One method would be for the debugger to search through the executable file looking for debug information. However, to save the debugger from having to search the file, a file characteristic field (IMAGE_FILE_DEBUG_STRIPPED) was invented that indicates that the file has been stripped. Debuggers can look for this field in the PE file header to quickly determine whether the debug information is present in the file or not. ŁThis method is not so much useful for TC point of view.ŁFor more info refer Internet Google Search for ﬁDebug Symbolsﬂ.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialThese are the ways of detecting a crash in the event of memory crash in ITK üNormally we analyze a crash using the portal\temp\syslogfilecreated for that particular session.üGet the file, function and line number.üThis can be even easy if we place the compiled .pdbfile along with the DLL, by which we can get the exact file, function name, line number details.üBut sometimes this method don™t work for all reasons, like programming errors, for example doing a strcat() operation on a variable which is defined and initialized as NULL, where we should have strcpy() first!.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialHow to detect programming memory crash errors, or the functionality defects due to poor logic, or looping?ŁThe following are the standard practices followed in any windowsprogramming:ŁUser Mode Debuggers:üAttach to Process and debug, like here in Teamcenter we have process called tcserver.exeüJust In Time Debugging.üCrash analysis using MAP files.üDebugging General FaultüCrash Dump Analysis Using Dr Watson.üMini Dump analysis.üDebugging using CRT(C Runtime libraries).üNTSD command line utility.ŁKernel mode Debuggers LNot used so far, useful for high complex systems programming.ŒKD Œto debug kernel-mode device drivers, provides assembly language debugging and isintended for system developers and device driver writers.

When a run-time error occurs to an application in the Customer™s PC, the developer can use a couple of debugging facilities provided by Window Operating system to collect the required information from the PC on which the application has crashed. One handy tool that offers the developers some means to collect a crash dump is Dr.Watsonfor Windows. Dr.Watsonis a tool that gets shipped on every NT based Windows Operating System.

ŁTo install Dr. Watson: drwtsn32 ŒI ŁTo run Dr. Watson: drwtsn32ŁSteps to use Dr. WatsonŁBefore running your application, start the Dr. Watson utility (DRWATSON.EXE) located in your Windows directory. This application will run in the background and generate a DRWATSON.LOG file in your Windows directory. Dr. Watson logs Windows activity. The .LOG file it generates contains important information about any errors that occur in a Windows session.ŁAfter a GP fault occurs, double-click the Dr. Watson icon to get a message box that says something like this: Ł1 new 'Dr. Watson' Failure Reports can be found in file'<windows directory>\drwatson.log' ŁThe most useful part of the file is undoubtedly the "stack dump (stack)" section. Using this information, you can determine the sequence of functions that were called and the function where the GP fault occurred. In addition, Dr. Watson indicates the exact assembler instruction where the failure occurred, and indicates the module information using: ( module name : logical segment : offset ) ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialDr WatsonŁDepending on the requirement, the developer may choose to selectthe Crash Dump type. It can be ‚Full™or ‚Mini™or ‚NT4 Compatible Full™. In most cases, a ‚Mini™dump would just suffice. If the developer needs to know more information than that would be provided by a Mini dump, then it would be good to create a ‚Full™dump. The Full crash dump will be a really huge file with the size of the orderof several Mega Bytes in most cases. Dr.Watsonwill create a log of the crash, which will have information such as the register contents during the crash and the stack trace etc. If the developer needsa crash dump file in order to load it using IDE such as MicrosoftVisual Studio .NETto browse the code where the crash happened, the check box ‚Create Crash Dump File™needs to be checked.ŁWhen the application crashes, with Dr.Watsonconfigured as mentioned above, a crash dump and a log file will be created. Developers need to get these files from the customer™s PC in order to analyze the cause of the crash. In many cases, the application would not have any debug information included. A Linker Map filewill be of great help to match the function addresses with the function names.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialAbnormal Program terminations at customer site.ŁAbnormal Program Terminations of Windows applications are not same as that of Run-time errors, and pose greater difficulty to debug when they occur in a Customer™s environment. Unhandled exception generally happens, when a part of the program throws an exception but there is no handler to catch the exception anywhere in the program. The exception will be caught by the run-time and the program will be abnormally terminated. Debugging such failures is more difficult. The reasons is when an exception is thrown, or when the program terminates abnormally (because of a call to the Run-time function abort()), Windows will not provide a way to have adebugger create a dump automatically, while Run-time errors can be debugged when they occur using tools such as Dr.Watson. Windows helps developers in such scenarios by providing a more sophisticated debugger called NTSD (NT Symbolic Debugger). NTSD is shipped along with all NT based Windows Operating Systems (such as NT4, 2000 and XP).©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialNTSD for Unhandled Exceptions, and Abnormal terminations.ŁNTSD proves to be a very handy debugger to deal with Unhandled Exceptions and Abnormal Program Terminations. NTSD can also be used to debug Run-time errors as well. NTSD will be located in <%WINDIR%>\System32folder. It can be invoked by typing NTSDfrom Command Prompt windowor from the Run Dialog. However, the main NTSD window will just display the various command line options that it can take, and will quit on hit of the Enter key.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialNow some magic on NTSD:ŁNTSD works on the context of a crashing application. The debugger can be made to attach to an existing process by providing the process ID as the command line parameter, or it can be made to start the application and debug it. In situations where it is not possible to run the failing application from the debugger, the debugger should be made to attach to the running application before it can crash. In most scenarios, it is possible to have NTSD start the faulting application. The following command will do the magic.ŁNtsdŒpe<Program File path> like in Teamcenter we can haveŁNtsdŒpeC:\UGS\teamcenter2005\TcServer.exe©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialDifficult situations in getting it attachedŁWhen the application cannot be debugged right from the start, then the developer needs to pass the Process ID of the application and pass it to NTSD as the command line option to have the process debuggedŁLike NtsdŒp 2534ŁIn the above command, 2534is the process ID of the process that is already running that needs to be debugged.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialMinidumpanalysisŁA minidumpis a file containing the most important parts of a crashed application. It is written on the user™s machine and then the customer can submit it to the developer. The developer can load the dump to help determine the cause of the crash and develop a fix.ŁSince the early days of Windows NT, the Dr. Watson program has been able to generate crash dump files, denoted with the .dmpextension. However, they were not as useful as they should have been because of two problems:ŁThey were huge. The dump of an application included every byte of the entire process space, so a crash in something simple like Notepad would be several megabytes in size, and a crash in something like Word can be many hundreds of megabytes. The fileswere just too big to send by e-mail or FTP. ŁTheir content was not necessarily useful. Dr. Watson was, in fact, a just-in-time (JIT) debugger, and it is difficult for a debugger to get the full path to a loaded module. Full debuggers such as the Visual Studio debugger complete a number of steps to get the paths, but Dr. Watson did not. This usually resulted in unhelpful module names such as MOD0000 and so on. ŁMinidumpswere designed to fix these problems in a number of ways:ŁInstead of saving the entire process space, only certain sections are saved. There is no point in saving copies of modules such as Kernel32.dll; if the version number is included, it is easy to get a copy from a Windows CD. The actual memory heap of the application is by default not saved in a minidump; it is not required to debug a surprisingly high percentage of crashes. You can save the heap if you need to, however. ŁThe minidumpsave code works to get accurate and full information for modules, including their names, paths, version information, and internal timestamps. ŁThe minidumpsave code also gets the list of threads, their contexts (that is, register sets), and the memory behind their stacks. ŁThe whole file is compressed, further reducing its size. A minidumpfor Notepad is around 6K on Windows XP, almost 300 times smaller than the previous crash dump of the same process. ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialCreating a mini dumpŁThere are three ways to create a minidump: ŁAdd code to your own application to write a minidumpif the application has an unhandled exception. ŁIn the integrated development environment of Visual Studio.NET, click Save Dump on the Debug menu when debugging the application. ŁDo nothing. ŁThe second option works only on a workstation with the debugger already configured, which is likely useful only within an organization (for example, with another developer or tester). If you debug a crash with Visual Studio.NET, you can then click Save Dump As on the Debug menu. You can save as a Minidumpor MinidumpWith Heap. You do not need any symbols or PDBsconfigured to save a dump file; you will need them later, however, to read it back.ŁThe third option works only in Windows XP, which automatically creates a minidumpif an application has an unhandled exception and no JIT debugger has been set up. Also, the minidumpis submitted directly to Microsoft, so you will not have the opportunity to determine why.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialBuild issues at customer siteŁTo configure your application to create dumps when it stops responding, you must configure your builds to generate full debugging information, especially for retail builds. After generating a PDB, you also must archive every binary that ships to customers and it™s matching PDB; you will need the PDB later to debug any minidumpsthat your customers submit.ŁAlso, ensure that you set the version information correctly on your binaries. Every release of every component that you ship should have a different version, so you can match them to the minidump. The version field assists you in matching the bits. The debugger itself does not use the version information, however; it matches binaries based on the internal timestamp in the PE header. ©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialDon™t allow PDB files shipped at customer™s place–Why??ŁIn terms of output, generating debug information for release builds has a small effect. A PDB, taking up some space on a build machine, is generated, and the binary will be a few hundred bytes larger, to record the name of the PDB in the debug directory within the PE file. You should not provide customers with the PDB; this could allow customers to more easily reverse-engineer your application.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialA Case StudyŁOne of our customers reported that the Windows application that we shipped them crashed when he tried to launch a dialog box. ŁOur development team tried a lot to reproduce the crash, but in vain, though the customer engineer was able to reproduce the crash at will. The customer is facing this problem only when he connects to a set of Servers. We could infer that the problem could be with the server. But, to know what exactly problem was, we need to know why the client application crashed.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialWhat to do now? Task force started–getting ready for the fun to deal such situations.ŁAs a first step, the development team restored the source code version that the customer is using from the source control, and built is to generate a MAP file. This is because, the customer is having a ‚Release™version of the application, which has no debug symbols in it. We certainly need a MAP file for debugging, if we get a crash dump.ŁWe first gave instructions to the customer engineer to configureDr.Watsonfor Windows to collect crash-dump file. He could not get a crash dump file, because he was not getting the dialog with ‚Abort™, ‚Cancel™and ‚Ignore™buttons. Instead, he was getting ‚Abnormal Program Termination™window. Dr.Watsoncould not be used for ‚Abnormal Program Terminations™. Such crashes are either because of unhandled exceptions, or when the program calls the Run-time function abort() for some reason.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialCollection of the crash dump.ŁWe decided to use NTSD (NT Symbolic Debugger) for debugging this particular problem. We can™t expect the customer engineer to know anything about application debuggers, and hence, we need to provide the customer with some tool or script file which will do most of the work, so that we can avoid any errors that might be due to manual procedures. NTSD is a command line debugger, and does not have a GUI to configure. All the configurations are to be done through commands. After a thorough study and research, we sent the following script to the customer.ŁmdC:\MyDumpsŁntsd-c "g;.dump/f /u C:\MyDumps\MyCrash.dmp;q" -peD:\UGS\bin\tcserver.exe©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialThen what? Next Step?ŁThe crash dump thus collected was sent to offshore by the customer engineer. The stack trace was analyzed and then address of the crash was matched with the MAP file, to know the part of code that was crashing. The exact line that resulted in the application crash was identified. The instruction was throwing an exception that was not handled anywhere in the program, and hence the ‚Abnormal Program Termination™error.ŁAfter thorough analysis, the problem was found to be in the server. The customer engineer had changed a file in the server, which had made the server to send the data to the client in an unexpected way.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialWhat is the best way of debugging, if we at the start of a project?  Answer: Adopt Defensive programming:Debugging during coding called defensive programming / proactive codingŁBest practice is to avoid bugs by catching and fixing them while coding. The following can be used for the same:»Usage of debug version macros.»‚ASSERT™family.»TRACE, OutputDebugStringand the ‚DebugViewer™»Debug log files.»Build options.»Debug Symbols (COFF,CV,PDB,DBG)»The CRTDBG ŒC Run-time debug library©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialProactive Coding / Debugging during coding ŒAssertionsŒThe assertion is simply a programmatic construct that allows youto assert that a particular condition is met, and conversely, if the condition is not met, to terminate execution.ŁAssertions shouldn't be confused with exceptions. Exceptions aremeant to communicate with the user. Typically, the user takes some action, and then possibly continues execution. In contrast, assertions are placed in the code to communicate with other programmers.ŁIn C and C++, the assert statement is a debug-only macro that aborts execution if its argument is false.ŁProsŒDebugging during coding. ŒGoes into the debugger to locate the bug, shows the stack traceŒNo overhead in Release buildŁCons ŒChange the state of the system by destroying the last error valueŁThe Assertion FamilyŒassert, _ASSERT, _ASSERTE, ASSERT_KINDOF, ASSERT_VALIDŁVerify:Same as Assert, only difference is that the condition is executed but no ASSERT failure if the condition fails in Release version.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialAssertŁan assertion declares that a certain condition must be trueŁat a specific point in a program. The assertion is said to fail if the condition is false. You use assertions in addition to normal error checking. Traditionally, assertions are functions or macros thatexecute only in debug builds and bring up a message box telling you what condition failed. Assertions are a key component of proactive programming because they help developers and test engineers determine not just that bugs are present but also why the errorsare happening. Assertions should never change any variables or states of a program. Treat all data you check in assertions as read-only. Because assertions are active only in debug builds, if you do change data by using an assertion, you'll have different behavior between debug and release builds, and tracking down the differences will be extremely difficult.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialHow to Assert©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialTraceŁA way to view the internal state of your program. Generally, these resolve down to the Win32 OutputDebugStringAPI or the Visual Basic Debug.Printobject method. ŁToo many trace statements are especially bad in real-world team development. ŁAnother problem is that a call to OutputDebugStringcan get expensive processing-wise. OutputDebugStringprocessing actually entails a process context switch on each call. If you look at the Win32 debug API, you will see thatone of the DEBUG_EVENT unions returned from WaitForDebugEventis OUTPUT_DEBUG_ STRING_INFO. That means your process stops and the debugger reads the information out of your address space. This can subtly change the timing on your multithreaded applications and lead to situations where it worksunder DEBUG builds (with OutputDebugStringcalls), and not under RELEASE builds. Even worse is when it runs in RELEASE builds, but not DEBUG builds.ŁIf you use Visual C++ 1.0, run the TRACER application from your Microsoft Visual C++ program group (its icon has the title "MFC Trace Options"). Select "Enable Tracing," then choose OK. If you use Microsoft C/C++ 7.0, you must copy the AFX.INI file from the Microsoft Foundation Class Library source directory (by default, C:\C700\MFC\SRC) to your Windows directory (by default, C:\WINDOWS). This file should contain a section such as the following:Ł[Diagnostics]TraceEnabled= 1TraceFlags= 0 As long as TraceEnabledis set to 1, tracing is enabled.ŁThis AFX.INI file is the same for both C/C++ 7.0 and Visual C++ 1.0. In Visual C++ 2.x, the TRACE output automatically goes to the 'Debug' window when you run in the debugger.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialC runtime Library(AdvancedTopic).ŁThe Visual C++ debugger and CRT library provide an effective setof tools for detecting and identifying memory leaks.ŁTo locate and isolate memory leaks and hard-to-detect bugs that can cause problematic behavior in applications developed with the C/C++ programming language.ŁOne of the most subtle and hard-to-detect bugs is the memory leakŠthe failure to properly de-allocate memory that was previously allocated.ŁTo enable the debug heap functions, you must include the following statements in your program:Ł#define _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC#include <stdlib.h>#include <crtdbg.h>The #includestatements must be in the order just shown. If you change the order, the functions you will use may not work properly. Including crtdbg.hmaps the mallocand freefunctions to their debug versions, _malloc_dbgand _free_dbg, which keep track of memory allocation and de-allocation. This mapping occurs only in a debug build (that is, only when _DEBUG is defined). Release builds use the ordinary mallocand freefunctions.ŁYou can dump memory leak information by including the following statement in your program: _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks();ŁWhen you run your program under the debugger, _CrtDumpMemoryLeaksdisplays memory leak information in the Debugtab of the Output window.ŁInstead of putting a call to _CrtDumpMemoryLeaksat each possible exit, you can include the following call at the beginning of your program:Ł_CrtSetDbgFlag( _CRTDBG_ALLOC_MEM_DF | _CRTDBG_LEAK_CHECK_DF); This statement automatically calls _CrtDumpMemoryLeakswhen your program exits. You must set both bit fields, _CRTDBG_ALLOC_MEM_DFand _CRTDBG_LEAK_CHECK_DF, as shown previously.ŁYou can reset this to dump to another location using _CrtSetReportMode. If you use a library, it may reset the output to another location. In that case, you can set the output location back to the Outputwindow using the following statement:Ł_CrtSetReportMode( _CRT_ERROR, _CRTDBG_MODE_DEBUG );To set a memory allocation breakpoint in your code, add a line like this (for the 18th memory allocation): _crtBreakAlloc= 18; As an alternative, you can use the _CrtSetBreakAllocfunction, which has the same effect:Ł_CrtSetBreakAlloc(18); Another technique for locating memory leaks involves taking snapshots of the application™s memory state at key points. The CRT library provides a structure type, _CrtMemState, which you can use to store a snapshot of the memory state:Ł_CrtMemStates1, s2, s3;To take a snapshot of the memory state at a given point, pass a _CrtMemStatestructure to the _CrtMemCheckpointfunction. This function fills in the structure with a snapshot of the current memory state: _CrtMemCheckpoint( &s1 ); You can dump the contents of a _CrtMemStatestructure at any point by passing the structure to the _CrtMemDumpStatisticsfunction:Ł_CrtMemDumpStatistics( &s3 );( &s1 ); To determine whether a memory leak has occurredin a section of code, you can take snapshots of the memory state before and after the section and then use _CrtMemDifferenceto compare the two states:Ł_CrtMemCheckpoint( &s1 );// memory allocations take place here_CrtMemCheckpoint( &s2 );if ( _CrtMemDifference( &s3, &s1, &s2) ) _CrtMemDumpStatistics( &s3 ); As the name implies, _CrtMemDifferencecompares two memory states (the last two parameters) and produces a result (the first parameter) that is the difference of the two states. Placing _CrtMemCheckpointcalls at the beginning and end of your program and using _CrtMemDifferenceto compare the results provides another way to check for memory leaks. If a leak is detected, you can use _CrtMemCheckpointcalls to divide your program and locate the leak using binary search technique.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialLets go deep in to all these debugging techniques.ŁAttach to process:ŒTask Manager->Select process->DebugŁIn Windows NT, open the Task Manager, right-click an active process, and select Debugin the pop-up window.

Œ-p switchŁYou can debug an active process with 32-bit editions of Microsoft Visual C++. You can attach to the active process by starting Visual C++using the undocumented -p switch, followed by the process identification number (PID). To obtain the PID for the process to be debugged, use theprocess viewer (PVIEW.EXE). Start PView. You will see something like this: ŁProcess               CPU Time      Privileged      User   MyApp(0xb7)           ... Here 0xb7 is the PID value of the application named MyApp.Start Visual C++ version 4.0 or later as follows: MSDEV -p 0xb7©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialAttaching to a process–contd.ŁWhen Visual C++ is loaded, look for statements in the status bar at the bottom of the screen stating that symbols for the application and its DLLs have been loaded. At this point, select the Debug menu, and choose the Break option to see the assembler listing in the main window. Bring up the call stack. Then double-click one of your functions. This brings up the source code for that source module in which a breakpoint can be set, or you can just open a source file and set a break point.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialJust In Time debuggingŁLaunches the debugger automatically when a program, running outside Visual Studio, encounters a fatal error.

For example, an application or a Windows component might read orwrite to a memory location that has not been allocated to it (memory that it does not own), potentially overwriting and corrupting other program code in that area of memory. ŁAnother situation where a GP fault may occur involves the passing of parameters between applications and the Windows environment. Invalid parameters can cause invalid instructions to be executed, resulting in GP faults. This is usually the result of an application's internal program code incorrectly passing specific data that could not be correctly interpreted by Windows or a Windows-based application.ŁUsing utilities such as Dr. Watson, CodeView for Windows, and the Visual Workbench debugger can make troubleshooting GP faults a little easier. The .MAP file created by the Visual C++ linker can also be helpful.©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialCrash DLL analysis:©2008 Wipro Ltd  -ConfidentialRemote Debugging( Needs Exploration)The whole key to remote debugging is ensuring your account is inthe Debugger Users group on the remote machine.

It will serve as a basis for making estimates and decisions.When the issue is implemented this document should be incorporated in the proper solution specification.	Current Functionality Notes on current client installation.The installation instructions for the current installation is found in the Reference section below.OTW RC + Catia interface:The current client installation is based on OTW (Over-The-Web). The number of distribution servers is currently 28. Each client is “pointing” to a certain distribution server from which it will download updates to the client when the client starts.For each distribution server three instances are set up “RC only”, “RC+Catia32” and “RC+Catia64”.The high number of distribution server is based on performance needs.Admin privileges are needed for the initial OTW installation. This is not needed for the later updates.MSI / SCCM RC + Catia Interface:Autumn 2014 have also created an msi package to make the first installation for clients. This msi package installs a number of files and makes a set of registry updates (see Appendix B)Testing is ongoing with pushing these updates using SCCM. Also the clients installed with msi/SCCM are downloading the updates from the OTW servers.The following mechanism is used to connect the client to the right distribution server to get updates when needed.All properties files are included in msi, otwinstaller.properties, when manually executed the argument of “site” is passed on the command line when msi is executed. When SCCM is used this argument is set on deployment.Admin privileges are not needed for initial installation if pushed with SCCMToday one msi package only exists that installs the Catia 64 version interface and RC.OrCAD Integration (Mechatronics):The OrCAD integration is distributed with an msi package that is manually installed by an Administrator.Updates to the OrCAD integration is distributed using OTW. These updates are distributed to all clients (not only clients with the OrCAD Integration), this is acceptable since the size of the updates is small.Catia Environment:The Catia Environment is set up by unpacking a zip file on the client. This zip file is distributed using e-gate or manual download.Geolus:The Geolus addition to the RC is distributed using a separate msi package that is manually installed (after request to Elux coordinator).CitrixManually installed and updated using TEM. Any changes to ootb client needs to be applied manually to Citrix.6 Citrix server currently in production.Current folder structure in c:\Siemens (all folders except OTW9 is for EDA interface)	   New Requirements / Decisions / SolutionSupported versionsTC and TCIC 32 bit client versions only (see discussion in Appendix A).Supported OS versions Our main platform for all tests will be Win 7 64 bit only and this is the recommended level for all clients.Rudimentary testing will be done also for XP32 and XP64 RC.Win7 32 bit is not supported (not used in Electrolux).Citrix will follow the same principles as today.Note that XP is not supported by Siemens or Microsoft, so no XP specific issues can be solved. Supported Catia versions 32/64After investigation it is shown that although a majority of clients is on Catia 64 at least two sites are running Catia 32 bit.Major version to test will be Catia 64. Catia 32 will be supported as much as possible considering win XP is not supported.Supported BrowsersIE is the main tool used at ElectroluxIE version is important for OTW and Active Workspace.The current IE version is 9 and the plan MAY be to upgrade to IE 11 during the early spring according to current information.We need to be prepared to support both IE 9 and IE 11 (may be that we will not support Active WS for IE 9)Java versionNote that Java is no longer included in the RC distribution.The minimum required version for JRE is 1.7 update 45 by TC 10.1.Java 8 will be certified with TC 10.1.3 according to latest information.The proposed solution is to install a jre version in the OTW10\otw\jre folder that will be pointed to by the otw_init.bat fileThis is to secure that we know what java version is used by the RC.This is not to be confused with the current situation where this java version is shipped from Siemens with the product. This new java folder is not part of Siemens deliverable.Version of Java to put in the OTW folder.Main options are latest release on 7 (71) or current release of 8.Update 2015-01-07: Java 8 is not supported with TC 10.1.3.Base tests on release 7_71.Installation toolsMSI and SCCMNote that the only options to install the client that is officially supported by Siemens is using OTW or TEM.It should be possible to make the basic installation using MSI + SCCM as it is today.OTW will still be used as the platform to distribute updates.The choice to make the initial installation using OTW or SCCM will be site based (depending on the maturity of the SCCM solution).New: The MSI package should be complete but should check if Catia is installed or not and the Catia interface should only be installed when relevant.Option (not currently selected)– “Riccardos script” to check for the current location could be used to find OTW server automatically.OTWOTW will still be used as one of the platforms for initial installations OTW will require administrative rights for the initial installation.Client updates will be done using OTWWorkaround for OTW issues with IE or java would be to run the .msi package instead where the problem exists.Limit the number of distribution serversIf possible the solution should reduce the number of distribution servers and instances.Identify if there are servers that can be removed due to few connected users (check US and Australia)Currently maximum number of connected users to one OTW instance is about 150 users (Pordenone distribution instance for Catia 64)Performance tests from some years back at Siemens indicated that there might be an issue if the number of simultaneous clients connected was too high. These are not hard facts but is should lead us to not increase the number of clients above what we currently have without making load tests.Only one instance will be used for most distribution servers.Support for Catia 32 will be handled with a few sites where needed have Catia 32 bit distribution instances.Always install Catia 64, if a small install is needed Citrix should be used instead. No check is done to remove Catia interface since TC might be installed before Catia.+/-:Advantage: Fewer instances to manageDisadvantage: Approx 150 MB extra will be needed on the client.Option ( not currently selected) – trigger msi package with OTW for complete base install.Msi package will download completely and then install the files as needed based on if Catia is installed and in what version (32 or 64).The site parameter used by the msi would be a context parameter to set on the OTW instance.+/-:Adantage: all clients installed the same way (using same msi package)Advantage: only one instance is neededDisadvantage: not a supported client installationDisadvantage: would probably be considerable effort to make it work (not done before)Disadvantage: large download of msi packageOrCAD interfaceSee document “Mechatronics Installation Document_Spinn5_V0x” The OrCAD interface will be initially installed using and msi package as it is today.Any updates will be managed through the OTW installation (and distributed to all clients)GeolusA separate msi package for installing the RC integration should be created.Active WSNo client installation is expected for Active WS but there is a dependency of Browser version. Only PCs with Win7 and IE 11 will be tested.Check (Johannes): Rumor says that HTML 5 is working better on other browsers than IE.Citrix and TEMCitrix will be installed using TEM as it is today.Note that the customized ootb files needs to be distributed also to Citrix.Upgrade processParallel executionIt must be possible for production clients to get TC10 installed and still have TC9 running.Check (Prasad) – impact of registry change by installing TC10 – see appendix B.It should be possible for test clients to have both TC9 and TC10 installed with a small effort activate one or the other.Client upgradeMinimum 4 weeks should be planned for administrators to install the TC10 client in parallel to the existing TC 9 installation using OTW or SCCM.Un-installing the TC 9 clientAfter the go live of TC10 it must be possible to uninstall TC9. Instruction / script is needed.Installation foldersTeamcenter / MechatronicsNew folder OTW10 for Rich Client.New folder EDA12 for OrCAD installation (note picture is incorrect below).Folders EDAconf, edastag and oracle will still be used.Content of EDAconf is identical and does not need to be changed.The caching folders should be renamed to tc10…..The tc9Teamcenter and Teamcenter should be combined to tc10Teamcenter.Open (Johannes): what is controlling the current folder Teamcenter\SOA? (Johannes)Catia setupNew folders created in the \Catia_V5R20\ELUX folder pointing to TC10.Workdirectory for TCIC should also be changed to point to new TC10 folder, this is done in the Catia environment files.OTW Settings“WindowsType” should be set to 32 as this forces a 32 bit client to be installed.“JREWindows32Location” should be set to “.”. This will run the OTW with the java used by the browser. Note 1: If this java can not be used for any site the msi package should be used instead for that site for the initial installation. Note 2: Setting this value to any specific path requires that a valid Java 1.7 jre exists in that folder. Since we do not have control over client java installation this is not used.OTW OOTB packagesOTW custom packagesCurrent custom packages:  New packages.Naming of icd files and zipe files should be consistent -  like EluxTcIC.icdEluxTcIC (EluxTcIC.icd)Containing the CAA binaries. Since changing these binaries requires that Catia is not running these two packages should be separated.EluxCustomTCICAddOnAll custom scripts and jar files for CatiaEluxGhostscriptSame as current gs813w32.EluxRacClientCurrent EluxClientSol + EluxCustomPortalEluxEnvSpecEnvironment specific files (different for Production, Validation, Test etc).Same content as current EluxMechatronicsSol EluxJreInstalls the jre version in Siemens\Teamcenter\jreEluxCATEnvCurrent content of Catia_V5R20 zip file currently manually distributed.Open: Magnus to confirm if this is to be included or not. EluxEdaPatchOOTB files for an EDA patch.

The change needs to be done also in the new TCIC 9.06 files.Rac.viewer jar file changeIn TC10 we are not planning to distribute this file.Site_specific.properties – set shareSession to false FMS_HOMEInstaller of TC10 will set as an environment variable this if it is not set currently.This should already be set by the tc9 install – this environment variable will not be used by by the RC or Catia interface since it is overridden in the otwportal.bat file.See above for discussion on how to solve this for the OrCAD interface.ReferencesSupport Matrix: TC 9 upgrade planning: Current installation instruction:  Java and IE :Appendix A- 32 or 64 bit client?So far we have been running a 32 bit TC client. What is best?DescriptionComment64+32 bit will not be supported in release 11Impact: WeakIt will take considerable time until E upgrades to 11 and at that time E could go to 6464+Siemens development on TCIC is currently testing 64 bit client only for 64 bit OS. However 32 bit should work and is supported.Impact: MediumSince we are only upgrading TCIC from 9.04 to 9.06 we are not expecting major issues on TCIC64+General advantage of 64 bitImpact: Weak to MediumPossible to address more memory. For large structures 64 bit should perform better – but this is not a current problem at E.64+The unknown 1Impact: ???If most customers have already switched to 64 when upgrading to 10 it is better to stay in the main stream…32+E will have 32 bit office.32 bit TC would give possibility to use embedded office functionality in RC.Impact: MediumCurrently little or no use is done with embedded functionality.32+EDA client. It will only be possible to launch EDA from inside Rich Client with double click on Schematic if 32 bit is used.Impact: Medium to StrongThis is currently used.But the number of users is not overwhelming.32+Possible to run XP 32 bitImpact: Weak to MediumWe will try not to support XP 32 but, taking the lead on this in E might be an issue….Note is that neither Siemens nor Microsoft supports XP.32+Memory consumption increases using 64 bit with 30-50%Impact: StrongSee information above from Deployment guide. E:s clients are not homogenous or well controlled so increasing memory requirements this way could be a significant issue.32+The unknown 2Impact: Medium Since we are currently running RC as a 32 bit client, issues could be found if we switch to 64.For example in our customization work on Windows.32 bit deprecated in release notesMS OfficeCurrent Electrolux MS-Office version is 2010 32 bit.Future planned version is 2013 32 bit.No plans for 64 bit.EDA – Mechatronics clientInput regarding TCICEmbedded visualizationMemory consumptionControlling TC bit version with OTWSee IR 7252954.New parameter named WindowsTypeSetting this to 32 or 64 will override the bit type of the IE that can also be used to control the version.Disable what is not used.CitrixShould be ok to run bot 32 and 64 according to information we got from Citrix team.Identify running version as 32 or 64 bitAppendix B – Registry updatesThese registry updates have been captured during installation and is not published by Siemens.TC 9 registry update changes[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\.ugs]"Content Type"="application/ugs-portal"@="ugsimanfile"[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/ugs-portal]"Extension"=".ugs"[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\ugsimanfile]"EditFlags"=""@="Teamcenter Rich Client"[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\ugsimanfile\Shell\Open]@="&Open"[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\ugsimanfile\Shell\Open\Command]@="C:\\Siemens\\Teamcenter\\OTW9\\rac\\otwportal.bat \"%1\""TC 10 registry update changesToDOAppendix C – Client Java VersionJava 8 support, Appendix D – EDA client upgrade

The program covers six different courses with around 145 hours of instructor-led classes, inclusive of course delivery, industry sessions like guest lectures, seminars, workshops, live projects, and career guidenace sessions. 1 Introduction to Data Science and Big Data Analytics This course “Introduction to Data Science and Big Data Analytics” enables the learners to:   Explore about the evolution of the Data Science and Big Data.   Know how the data is being generated exponentially in businesses.    Understand on how the business data generated is to be handled with Big Data technologies, governed and secured.   2 Foundational Statistics and EDA At the end of this course, the learners will be able to:  Apply the concepts of averaging, variations, skewness, and kurtosis in solving a business problem.  Discuss about the formal hypothesis testing and relate testing procedures to estimation via confidence intervals. Predict one variable from the other variables and determine the line of best fit as well as apply multiple regression and multiple correlation techniques.  3 Analysing Data through R and Python This course enables the learners to:   Understand the fundamentals of programming using the Data Analytic tools. Perform analytical modelling with data.  Create graphs using the data for decision makers using various libraries in both two and three-dimensional spaces.   Mine the information hidden within the data to aid decision making in the businesses problems. 4 Understanding Machine Learning At the end of this course, the learners will be able to:  Handle, clean, and prep the data.  Engineer the features.  Develop a model with the data with the right supervised and unsupervised algorithms through development, validation, and testing.  Overcoming the challenges like over-fitting and under-fitting the data. 5 Big Data Ecosystems  and Frameworks with Hadoop This course makes the learners gain expertise in:  Map Reduce and its qualities.  Hadoop data storage principles.  Big Data tools like Hive, Pig, Yarn, Scoop, Oozie, Storm, Flume.  Creating solutions using analytics in the Big Data environment. 6 Data Visualization This course will make the learners:  Handle, explore, and visualize the data of various business domains through business intelligence tools like Tableau and QlikView. Present the data in the graphical format to help the business users to take decisions by discovering new patterns.   Our Pedagogy hexplains how we implement the instruction of our well-framed curriculum. It involves three different phases: Foundation, Specialization and Realization.
                     Foundation Phase 
                     During this first and foremost phase of the program, the foundational concepts of statistics, programming, data science and analytics will be covered.

                     Specialization Phase  
                      In the second phase of the program, core concepts of machine learning, big data frameworks, and data visualizations are covered. In this phase, the learners can test their understanding through problem solving exercises, case studies, etc.

                     Realization phase  
                     This is the most important phase because the learners will be applying their knowledge in data science for a real-life problem and try to figure out the best alternative solution.

                     Industry Lectures 
                      In addition to the course content, GradValley will be offering seminars, guest lectures, and workshops by data science professionals from the industry in parallel to the course curriculum for a better understanding among the learner community. It also aids in bridging the gap between the academia and industry.

                     Mentoring Through Industry Experts  
                      To ensure the overall development of our learners, we provide regular mentoring sessions. Each and every learner enrolled for the program will be assigned to a data science professional in the corporate and contact sessions will be arranged on a one-on-one basis.

                     Capstone Project/Internship 
                      As a part of the program completion, the learners have to complete the capstone project or do an internship.

This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.

The code that caused this warning is on line 411 of the file w2v_space.py. To get rid of this warning, pass the additional argument 'features="html.parser"' to the BeautifulSoup constructor.
